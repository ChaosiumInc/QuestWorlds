## 3.1 As-You-Go Method

1. Choose a **concept**. Your **concept** is a brief phrase, often just a couple of words that tells the GM and other players what you do and how you act. Start with a noun or phrase indicating your **occupation keyword** or area of expertise, and modify it with an adjective suggesting a **distinguishing characteristic**, a personality trait that defines you in broad strokes:

### 3.1.1 EXAMPLE CONCEPTS

|Distinguishing Characteristic|Occupation|
|:---------------------------:|:---------|
|Haughty|Priestess|
|Hotshot|Lawyer|
|Noble|Samurai|
|Remorseful|Assassin|
|Sardonic|Ex-mercenary|
|Slothful|Vampire|
|Naive|Warrior|


2. Provide your character with a name.
3. You have 12 **ability** slots and up to three slots for **flaws**.
4. Your character concept uses two slots: one for their occupational **keyword** and one for their **distinguishing characteristic**.
5. The first time you use an **ability** (including your **distinguishing characteristic** and **occupational keyword**), assign a **rating** to it (see ยง3.4).
6. If the series uses other **keywords**, such as those for culture or religion, you will need to spend an **ability** slots on those.
7. When events in the story put you in a situation where you want to overcome a **story obstacle**, or discover the answer to a **story question**, make up an applicable **ability** on the spot. This may be a **breakout ability** from a **keyword**. You are restricted to only one **sidekick**.
8. If you want, describe any **flaws**.
9. When you have used all your **ability** slots, you must use **experience points** to buy more. Once you have used all of your **flaw** slots, you must buy off an existing **flaw** with **experience points** to gain more.
