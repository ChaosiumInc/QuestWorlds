## 2.7 Triggering Flaws

During play, either you, or your GM, may decide that your **flaw** has been triggered. A **flaw** might apply to the **tactic** you are using in upcoming **contest**, when it is called a **hindrance** (see §2.7.1). Alternatively a **flaw** might simply come into play when you want to describe your PC acting in a certain way, and you or your GM feels that one of your **flaws** could prevent this, or you, or your GM, feel that a situation raises a challenge that means one of your **flaws** would lead to you responding in a certain way. 

### 2.7.1 Hindrance

if you describe a **tactic** for a **contest** that is in conflict with a **flaw**, your GM may decide to impose a **penalty** called a **hindrance** against you in the upcoming **contest**. You should choose to remind your GM when you feel a flaw might be triggered. Your GM may also use an **ability** on your character sheet against you in this way too, if appropriate. This may be the case for relationships you have, philosophies you espouse, or groups you belong to. 

Your GM should follow a similar approach to **augments** when applying a **hindrance**. They should ask themselves if it is *fresh*, *interesting* or *illuminates character*. In a movie of book would your **flaw** be prominent here?

If your GM feels that there is no uncertainty as to whether the **flaw** applies to your **tactic** in the contest they apply a **penalty** of -3 or -6 depending on how serious a handicap the **flaw** is. (In effect an **assured contest** for the flaw). 

If your GM feels that it is uncertain as to whether the **flaw** hinders you, or you are able to overcome it, and you agree that you wish to try, treat it as a **simple contest**. Roll the rating of your **flaw** against the **base resistance**. On a **victory**, you receive a **penalty** from the **rank** of your **victory** - if you get *zero* successes use a **rank** one **penalty** of -3, on *one* **success** a **rank** two **penalty** of -6 and so on. On a **defeat**, you overcome the **flaw**.

When you experience a **penalty** due to a flaw, you gain an **experience point** (see §8.1).

### 2.7.2 Act according to your flaw

At times the direction of the story you are all telling may place your PC in situations when it seems likely they would act according to their **flaw**. The addict may reach for drink or drugs following an emotional setback, a lust for vengeance may come between your PC and showing mercy, prejudices or bigotry may prevent you from seeing others positively.  

If you chose to act according to your **flaw** there is no contest, simply describe your character behaving as the **flaw** dictates. This might result in a **hindrance** to further actions (see §2.6.1)

If you wish to act against your **flaw**, your **tactic** must pass a **credibility test** as to how you try overcome your **flaw** in this instance. In effect, pick an **ability** to resist the **flaw** with. Then you must obtain a **victory** in a **simple contest** against your **flaw**. On a **victory** you may act in a way that contradicts your **flaw**.

If you submit to your **flaw**, your GM might impose a **hindrance** on further actions (see §2.6.1). You should not contest this **hindrance** unless the situation is not related to the one which triggered your **flaw** in this instance, or significant time has now passed.

Your GM may impose a **penalty** against an **ability** if you gain the **victory** against your **flaw** representing your struggle against your inner nature, violating dearly held principles, or letting down dependents. This is often true where the GM invokes a flaw from a **keyword**. For example, if you had they **keyword** "Gangster" and decide to inform on a fellow mobster, your GM might invoke the **flaw** of "Code of Silence" even if it is not a **breakout** under you **keyword**; this is particularly appropriate where facts such as the "Code of Silence" have been established in game. Even if you overcome your **flaw**, and inform on your fellow mobster, the GM might still impose a **penalty** on use of the **keyword** to interact with your crime family for having breached the "Code of Silence."
 
Similarly, your GM might give you a **bonus** for acting according to your **flaw**. representing the sacrifices you have made for dependents or a temporary boost from satisfying your inner demons. For example, if your superhero "Speedster" goes to see the premiere of his partner's new play, instead of heading to the docks to stop Dr. Squid's shipment of Vibrium, your GM might award you a **bonus** to your relationship to your partner.

If you choose to, or your GM compels you to, act according to a **flaw**, you gain an **experience point** (see §8.1).
