# 9.0 Community Resources and Support

Some series revolve around the relationship between a band of influential figures and the community they protect. In defense of the community, they can **bolster**, expend, and juggle its various **resources**.

These rules allow your GM to track the rise and fall of the fortunes of your community, and your impact on them.

If your GM intends to play a game centered around a community, you should have a **keyword** for that community.

It is possible that you have relationships with other communities that are not the focus of play. Treat these **abilities** as relationships that you can call on, but your GM should not track these communities with those rules. Your GM should pick the level of community that provides the greatest dramatic potential from its competition for **resources**, friendly or otherwise, with its rivals.

Some campaigns do not center on a community, with the adventurers being footloose wanderers. In that case, even if you have community **abilities**, your GM will not track any community. Before your GM decides this, they should consider where your PCs might turn for help, succor, or aid. Is there somewhere in the campaign defined as a place of refuge and safety for you? It may well be that  is a community. For example, the bar where other footloose adventurers all meet, who will help each other out in a tight spot.
