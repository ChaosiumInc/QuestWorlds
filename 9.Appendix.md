## Version Changes

### Version 2.2

* Uses of he/she changed to they/their
* Flagged some rules that are not required, as optional to allow those using the SRD to safely omit them if not required.
* Clarified that contest results are only reciprocal between PCs. When the contest is against a resistance set by the GM, the results indicate whether the PC gains the prize, and the GM narrates the result for the resistance based on this.
* Rephrased the contest results to emphasize: Yes, No, And..., But..., This change is designed to dissuade GMs from misunderstanding that the prize is obtained on a marginal victory, one of the most common result types, and instead encourage GMs to allow PCs to fail forward on such a result by introducing downstream complications.
* Provided clarity that consequences of defeat and benefit of victory are optional and the GM should focus on using the prize to narrate the outcome of a contest, only applying mechanical benefits if they make sense. 
* Specific Ability Bonuses are dropped. They were hard for the GM to adjudicate and the same intent is better served by using a stretch on a broad ability when contesting against a PC with a more specific ability.
* A winning group in a Group Simple Contest does not suffer a Consequence of Defeat as a result of a low RP difference victory any more, the GM should narrate consequences from the level of victory, if appropriate.
* Dropped the negative consequences for the winner in an Extended Contest during the Rising Action. If the winner is a PC the degree of success already suggests consequences in addition to the prize on a marginal victory. So this rule is over-complication.
* Made it clear that only a PC should use a parting shot, not the resistance.
* Switched to addressing you the player, using your GM for the Games Master, and we for the game authors
* Long contests include both extended contest and scored contests. Between 1 and 2 extended contests switched to scored contests, this approach restores both variants, but requires changing the generic name to a long contest.
* Dropped edges and handicaps from extended contests - we use a resistance not stats, so makes no sense to have edges and handicaps
* Added alternate mechanisms for determining if resistance advances and when
* Added story-based resistance mechanics
* Added story-based improvements
* Added States of Fortune to mirror States of Adversity. Overall mirrored benefits and consequences more closely
* Added Escalating Contests
* Added Mythic Russia's Plot Edits
* Added Mythic Russia's Pyrrhic Victories for Extended Contests but as Climatic Contests
* Changed degree of success and failure, to degree of victory and defeat, as success and failure are for individual rolls, victory and defeat once compared.
* Simplified how multiple opponents are handled
* Clarified contest outcomes for long contests, and how to determine the overall winner in a long contest
* Do not allow transfers in an extended contest where the abilities differ by 6 or more. Consistent with benefits of victory and prevents 'loading up on mooks' as a strategy.
