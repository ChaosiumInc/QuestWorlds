## 3.2 Keywords

You may build your PC around one or more **keywords**. A **keyword** gives you a package deal: you get a number of **abilities** by selecting a pre-existing character concept, which the player then modifies.

**Keywords** are best suited for use as the PC’s **occupation**. Often a keyword represents an occupation common the genre and has a narrative description of that occupation.

In certain genres, you may require multiple **keywords**: for example, one for **occupation**, another for species or culture, and perhaps a third for religious affiliation.

Treat **keywords** as shorthand for a package of **abilities**. The list of **abilities** is open-ended, but your GM's genre pack at least has a text description, which hints at the credible uses of a package **keyword**, and might provide a list of suggested **abilities** for unfamiliar settings, where it is less clear what a **keyword** encompasses. Even if there is a suggested list, the potential uses of the **keyword** are always open-ended, provided they are credible. In the kinds of fiction that *QuestWorlds* emulates it is usually enough to know that someone has a particular **occupation** or **heritage** to know what they can do.

### 3.2.1 Breakouts

If your character is particularly good at an aspect of a **keyword**, you create a **breakout ability** under the **keyword** at a **bonus** from the **rating** of the **keyword** you write these specialized **breakout abilities** under the **keyword**, along with how much they've improved from the **keyword**:

Detective 15

* Deduction +5
* Hard Drinking +5

In this example, whilst the **rating** for most **contests** in which Detective was an appropriate **tactic** would be 15, for contests involving Deduction it would be 20.

**Breakouts** may be similar to the list of **abilities** that the package of **abilities** would include. However, as these tend to be assumed in the **keyword** which is already treated as an **ability** it is more interesting to have them *differentiate* your PC as an archetype from others. For example, if you want to portray the *stereotype* of the hard-drinking detective, you might add that as a **breakout** under the **keyword**. That **breakout** might also be flagged as a **flaw**.

### 3.2.2 Doubling Up

In some settings, an **ability** may be listed in more than one of a PC’s **keywords**. You should choose only one to list it under.

If your **distinguishing characteristic** is an **ability** that fits under a **keyword** then you can make it a breakout there.
