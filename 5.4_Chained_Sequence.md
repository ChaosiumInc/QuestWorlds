## 5.4 Chained Sequence

A **chained sequence** consists of one or more **rounds**; each **round** is a **contest**.

Electing to use a **chained sequence** changes all **contests** into **sequences**. A **contest** is always just a **round** of a **sequence**.

In a **chained sequence** each **round** represents an attempt by both parties to overcome their opponent. After each **round**, participants who are able to continue must decide if they wish to continue the **sequence** or if they wish to **disengage** and yield the **prize** to their opponent.

In a **chained sequence** we track **resolve**. Once contestants **resolve** reaches *zero* they cannot continue without recovering **resolve** (see §5.4.9).

When electing to use **chained sequences** be aware of the impact of this choice.

Your GM may should award **benefits** to a victorious PC after the **sequence** ends (see §2.6), but all **consequences**, other than loss of the **prize**, come from trading **resolve** for **consequences** (see §5.4.2).

Your GM should determine who has the initiative to describe what they are doing for any **round**, based on their interpretation of the flow of events. If in doubt your GM should defer to you over your opponent to describe what you do in the **round**, and describe the NPC reacting to that.

### 5.4.1 Resolve

**Resolve** represents your resistance to the exhaustion of your mental, physical, emotional or social reserves. Once your **resolve** is gone, you quit.

The loser of a **round** in a **sequence**, looses **resolve** equal to their opponent's **degrees of victory** plus one, see §5.4.1.1.

When your resolve hits *zero* it initiates a crisis, your desire to struggle on is gone: you collapse into exhaustion; you give in to despair; you succumb to your wounds; you flee in fear... depending on what harmed you. You cannot continue with the **sequence** and lose the **prize**. Until you recover positive **resolve**, you must rest and may not initiate a **sequence**.

### 5.4.1.1 RESOLVE LOSS TABLE

|Degree of Victory    |Lost Resolve    |
|:-------------------:|:--------------:|
|0|1|
|1|2|
|2|3|
|3|4|
|4|5|

### 5.4.3 PC Resolve

A PC begins with *five* **resolve**. On your PC's sheet record your current **resolve**. You can use check boxes to visually represent **resolve**.

#### 5.4.3.1 Exchange Resolve for Consequences

As an alternative to losing **resolve** in a contest, you can choose to take a **consequence**. Taking a **consequence** concedes the **sequence**, and you yield the **prize**.

Your GM should create a **consequence** which should be appropriate to the source of harm. A **consequence** only negates **resolve** losses from the most recent **round**; a consequence cannot negate **resolve** losses from earlier **rounds**. If you accept that **consequence** you do not lose **resolve** for this **round** but instead take the **consequence**.

* Instead of marking 1 point of **resolve**, the GM offers a penalty -5.
* Instead of marking 2 points of **resolve**, the GM offers a penalty of -10.
* Instead of marking 3 points of **resolve**, the GM offers a penalty of -15.
* Instead of marking 4 points of **resolve**, the GM offers a penalty of -20.

You can't buy off 5 points of **resolve**, instead your resolve is immediately reduced to *zero* and you yield the **sequence**.

### 5.4.3.2 Shift Resolve Loss to Followers

**Followers** may augment your character in a **chained sequence**.

In addition, if you suffer a **defeat** in a **round** of a **chained sequence** you may transfer that **resolve** loss to a **follower**. Doing so takes that **follower** out of further **rounds** of the **chained sequence**. Any **augment** they provided is lost.

If a **follower** absorbs *two* or less points of **resolve**, you can use recovery to return them to your service. You must recover their resolve losses, otherwise they leave your service exhausted, or succumbing to their wounds.

If a **follower** absorbs *three or more* **resolve** they leave your service immediately, again perhaps exhausted or succumbing to wounds, and must be replaced.

### 5.4.4 NPC Resolve

We divide NPCs into two categories for **resolve**: mooks and named NPCs.

Your GM should track **resolve** losses for an NPC. An NPC cannot trade **resolve** losses for a **consequence**.

#### 5.4.4.1 Mooks

A mook is a faceless, nameless NPC who exists to allow your PC to impress us with their competency. A mook yields a **sequence** after suffering *one* point of **resolve** loss.

#### 5.4.4.2 Named NPCs

A named NPC starts with between *two* and *three* **resolve**.

* *Two* resolve: a recurring character, who appears in multiple scenes.
* *Three* resolve: a main character, who the unfolding story hinges around.

Your GM should decide if an NPC has recovered any **resolve** losses between encounters. An NPC who is reduced to *zero* resolve should not re-appear in the story - your PC has overcome them.

Some rare encounters, extraordinary NPCs who your GM intends as an individual threat to a group of NPCs, may have greater **resolve**. This should be used sparingly.

### 5.4.5 Resolve for Impersonal Opposition

Impersonal opposition - a security system, a science or engineering problem, a mountain to climb or wilderness to cross - can have resolve too, representing how resistant it is to conquest. Impersonal opposition may include people, where are large number can be treated in an abstract fashion - the prison guards, the ship's crew - as such the rating reflects a collective resistance.

To justify loss of a PC's resolve in a conflict, only call for a **sequence** when it can be explained how a PC might become worn out attempting to overcome the obstacle or run out of time, otherwise let the PC succeed if they have a relevant **ability**. The **resolve** of impersonal opposition represents PC progress - as the PCs' complete more steps towards overcoming the opposition - defeating security systems, winning hearts and minds - then the **resolve** of the impersonal opposition ebbs away.

For a lot of impersonal opposition, where it has not taken on the role of a "character" or become a key obstacle in the evolving story, just set the **resolve** at *one*.  

For more challenging impersonal opposition, consider setting **resolve** at *two* or *three* for an individual, or higher if overcoming it is a group effort.

### 5.4.6 Group Chained Sequence Outcomes

In a **group chained sequence** the side that has the last contestant that has not disengaged or exhausted their **resolve** gains the **prize**.

### 5.4.7 Parting Shot

There are no **parting shots** in a **chained sequence**.

### 5.4.8 Assists

You may either **augment** a teammate to improve their **TN** or help them recover **resolve**.

### 5.4.9  Joining an In-Progress Contest

On a **round** of a **group chained sequence**, if you are otherwise unengaged you can engage with any opponent who remains. As **resolve** only changes with **recovery** both participants use their existing **resolve**.

#### 5.4.10 Recovery

Your PC will recover over time. Your GM should decide at what point your character's resolve heals and they can return to play. If you wish to speed up your return to play, use the **Recovery** rules (see §2.8.3). The **resistance** (see §2.8.3.2) depends on your remaining **recovery** and is shown in the table below.

If your resolve becomes exhausted (reaches *zero*), you return to play with your **resolve** permanently reduced by *one*. This is the impact of trauma on your reserves to cope with further stresses. If this reduction takes your **resolve** to *zero* your PC succumbs to the strains of an adventurous life and must retire from play, perhaps dead, perhaps in exile, perhaps incapacitated. It is time to create a new character.
