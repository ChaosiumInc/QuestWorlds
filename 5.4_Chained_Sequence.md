## 5.4 Chained Sequence

A **chained sequence** consists of one or more **rounds**; each **round** is a **contest**.

Electing to use a **chained sequence** changes all **contests** into **sequences**. A **contest** is always just a **round** of a **sequence**.

In a **chained sequence** each **round** represents an attempt by both parties to overcome their opponent. After each **round**, participants who are able to continue must decide if they wish to continue the **sequence** or if they wish to **disengage** and yield the **prize** to their opponent.

In a **chained sequence** we track **resolve**. Once your **resolve** reaches *zero* you cannot continue without recovering **resolve** (see ยง5.4.9).

When electing to use **chained sequences** be aware of the impact of this choice.

Your GM should award **consequences** and **benefits** to a victorious PC after the **sequence** ends (see ยง2.6).

Your GM should determine who has the initiative to describe what they are doing for any **round**, based on their interpretation of the flow of events. If in doubt your GM should defer to you over your opponent to describe what you do in the **round**, and describe the NPC reacting to that.

### 5.4.1 Resolve

**Resolve** represents your resistance to the exhaustion of your mental, physical, emotional or social reserves. Once your **resolve** is gone, you quit.

The loser of a **round** in a **sequence**, loses **resolve** equal to their opponent's **degrees of victory** plus one, see ยง5.4.1.1.

When your resolve hits *zero* it initiates a crisis, your desire to struggle on is gone: you collapse into exhaustion; you give in to despair; you succumb to your wounds; you flee in fear... depending on what harmed you. You cannot continue with the **sequence** and lose the **prize**. Until you recover positive **resolve**, you must rest and may not initiate a **sequence**.

Your **resolve** may become negative due to losses from a **round**. You cannot return to play until your **resolve** becomes positive.

### 5.4.1.1 RESOLVE LOSS TABLE

|Degree of Victory    |Lost Resolve    |
|:-------------------:|:--------------:|
|0|1|
|1|2|
|2|3|
|3|4|
|4|5|

### 5.4.2 Chained Sequence Outcomes

Your GM uses the number of **resolve points** scored against the losing contestant to determine the **degree** of your **victory** or **defeat**. Do not count **resolve points** traded for **consequences**, but do count any losses absorbed by followers.

#### 5.4.2.1 CHAINED SEQUENCE OUTCOME TABLE

|Loss    |Degree     |
|:------:|:------------:|
|1|0|
|2-3|1|
|4-5|2|
|6-7|3|
|8+|4|

Your GM applies results as described in ยง2.3.7.2, including assigning **benefits** and **consequences**.

### 5.4.3 PC Resolve

A PC begins with a *starting* **resolve** of *five*. On your PC's sheet record your current **resolve**. You can use check boxes to visually represent **resolve**.

#### 5.4.3.1 Exchange Resolve for Consequences

As an alternative to losing **resolve** in a **round**, you can choose to take a **consequence**.

Your GM should create a **consequence** which should be appropriate to the source of harm. A **consequence** only negates **resolve** losses from the most recent **round**; a consequence cannot negate **resolve** losses from earlier **rounds**. If you accept that **consequence** you do not lose **resolve** for this **round** but instead take the **consequence**.

* Instead of marking 1 point of **resolve**, the GM offers a penalty -5.
* Instead of marking 2 points of **resolve**, the GM offers a penalty of -10.
* Instead of marking 3 points of **resolve**, the GM offers a penalty of -15.
* Instead of marking 4 points of **resolve**, the GM offers a penalty of -20.

You can't buy off 5 points of **resolve**, instead your resolve is immediately reduced to *zero* and you yield the **sequence**.

#### 5.4.3.2 Resolve and Incredible Powers

In some settings your use of incredible powers may be exhausting and may cost **resolve**.

A setting may use one of several approaches to **resolve** losses for incredible powers.

* Usage of the power costs **resolve** on any **degree of defeat**.
* Usage of the power costs resolve on a partial victory (*zero* **degrees of success**).

### 5.4.4 Followers

You may choose to have your **followers** take part in **chained sequence** in one of three ways: as full contestants, as secondary contestants, or as supporters. You track resolve for **followers** as you do for a PC, but a **follower** begins the game with *three* resolve. **Retainers** are treated as a group for tracking **resolve** but **sidekicks** are handled individually.

**Contestant**: The **follower** takes part in the **contest** as any other PC would. You roll for your **followers** as you would their main characters.

**Secondary contestant**: To act as a secondary contestant, your **follower** must have an **ability** relevant to the **contest**. The follower provides an **augment** to your character in a **chained sequence**. In addition, if you suffer a **defeat** in a **round** of a **chained sequence** you may transfer that **resolve** loss to a **follower**. Doing so takes that **follower** out of further **rounds** of the **chained sequence**, even if they still have remaining **resolve**. Any **augment** your **follower** provided is lost.

**Supporter**: Your **follower** is present in the scene, but does not directly engage your opponents. Instead they may perform **assists** and other **unrelated actions**.

If a **follower** checks off *three or more* **resolve** they leave your service immediately - they may be dead, exhausted, or in despair - and must be replaced.

### 5.4.5 NPC Resolve

We divide NPCs into two categories for **resolve**: mooks and named NPCs.

Your GM should track **resolve** losses for an NPC. An NPC cannot trade **resolve** losses for a **consequence**.

#### 5.4.5.1 Mooks

A mook is a faceless, nameless NPC who exists to allow your PC to impress us with their competency. A mook yields a **sequence** after suffering *one* point of **resolve** loss.

#### 5.4.5.2 Named NPCs

A named NPC starts with between *three* and *five* points of **resolve**.

Your GM should decide if an NPC has recovered any **resolve** losses between encounters. An NPC who is reduced to *zero* resolve should not re-appear in the story - your PC has overcome them.

Some rare encounters, NPCs who your GM intends as an individual threat to a group of NPCs, may have greater **resolve**. This should be used sparingly.

### 5.4.6 Resolve for Impersonal Opposition

Impersonal opposition - a security system, a science or engineering problem, a mountain to climb or wilderness to cross - can have resolve too, representing how resistant it is to resolution. Impersonal opposition may include people, where are large number can be treated in an abstract fashion - the prison guards, the ship's crew - as such the **rating** reflects a collective **resistance**.

To justify your loss of **resolve** in a conflict, your GM should only call for a **sequence** when it can be explained how you might become worn out attempting to overcome the obstacle or run out of time, otherwise your GM should let you succeed if you have a relevant **ability**. The **resolve** of impersonal opposition represents your progress - as you complete more steps towards overcoming the opposition - defeating security systems, winning hearts and minds - then the **resolve** of the impersonal opposition ebbs away.

For a lot of impersonal opposition, where it has not taken on the role of a "character" or become a key obstacle in the evolving story, your GM will just set the **resolve** at *one*.  

For more challenging impersonal opposition, your GM may consider setting **resolve** at  *three* for an individual conflict, or higher if overcoming it is a group effort. Where **resolve** represents overcoming a group being treated as a single opponent, then a **resolve** of *four* of *five* may be appropriate.

### 5.4.7 Group Chained Sequence Outcomes

In a **group chained sequence** the side that has the last contestant that has not disengaged or exhausted their **resolve** gains the **prize**.

### 5.4.8 Parting Shot

If you succeed in your **parting shot** roll, you inflict additional **resolve** losses on your opponent, worsening their **defeat**.

However, if your opponent succeeds, they take the number of **resolve** they would, in a standard **round**, score against you, and instead subtracts them from the **resolve** scored against them in the **round** that removed them from the **contest**. If your opponent now has positive **resolve**, they return to the **sequence**, and may re-engage you. Your GM describes this as a dramatic turnaround, in which your overreaching has somehow granted them an advantage allowing them to recover from their previous misfortune.

Where it makes sense, unengaged PCs may attempt **parting shots** against opponents taken out of the **sequence** by someone else. You may not revive your teammates by using your lamest abilities to make **parting shots** on them; this, by definition, does not pass a **credibility test**.

### 5.4.9 Assists

An unengaged PC or follower may attempt to help another PC recover **resolve**.

### 5.4.10  Joining an In-Progress Contest

On a **round** of a **group chained sequence**, if you are otherwise unengaged you can engage with any opponent who remains. As **resolve** only changes with **recovery** both participants use their existing **resolve**.

### 5.4.11 Recovery

Without intervention, your PC will recover, given time. Your GM should decide at what point your character recovers their resolve and can return to play. As a guideline: one or two points of resolve heal with a short rest, good meal, or time spent relaxing with friends; three or four points of resolve requires a longer period of recuperation, therapy or medical assistance; five points of resolve requires a long period of peaceful rest, away from conflict, to heal.

You may decide that you cannot wait for time to restore your PC, and instead want to use **abilities** to accelerate your **recovery**.

#### 5.4.11.1 Recovery Abilities

When deciding what **tactic** to use for **recovery**, credible choices depend on the nature of the conflict.

* Medical **abilities** both conventional and incredible, such as first aid, trauma surgery, regenerative powers or AI doctors, can be used to recover from physical injuries.
* Psychological **abilities** both conventional and incredible, such as therapy, psychiatry, meditation or telepathy, can be used to recover from mental injuries.
* Social **abilities** both conventional and incredible, such as leadership, charisma, magical glamours or familiarity with social networks can help recovery from social injuries.
* Engineering **abilities** such as mechanical repair, fusion engineering or blacksmithing can be used to repair damage to equipment.
* **Abilities** that represent beliefs, convictions, or ties to a community can be used in multiple situations to recover, representing the emotional ties that keep your PC going despite adversity. Your GM is encouraged to be liberal when allowing the usage of emotional ties to recover, provided their usage is 'fresh' within an episode.

#### 5.4.11.1 Recovery Sequences

Any attempt to recover is also a **chained sequence**. Your GM must decide how long each round takes in game time - the limitation on attempts to restore **resolve** is usually  time.

On a **victory** you restore **recovery** equal to the **degrees of victory** plus *one* (see 5.4.11.2).

On a **defeat** your GM has the following options:

* Lost time is the only penalty - use this when there is little risk to helping others.
* The helping PC loses **resolve** - use this when there is a risk of the helping PC becoming exhausted or otherwise drained by their efforts.
* The PC being helped loses further **resolve** - use this when any intervention carries a risk of worsening the position such as when attempting to fix losses to relationships or mental health.

As with all **resolve** losses the PC losing **resolve** may opt to take a **consequence** instead, and the recovery **sequence** ends immediately. If it is credible, then **resolve** losses during recovery may also be transferred to **followers**.

The resistance for a recovery roll is always the **default** resistance.

When nested within another sequence the first **recovery** roll faces the **base resistance**. Each subsequent **recovery** attempt to the same beneficiary increases the **resistance** by +5. The **resistance** escalation occurs even when another PC steps in to make a subsequent **recovery**. This escalation allows the occasional dramatic rescue but makes it difficult for players to prolong losing battles to excruciating length. Increasing attempts to bring someone back from exhaustion become harder.

#### 5.4.11.2 RECOVERY OUTCOME TABLE

|Degrees of Victory|Gain| Degrees of Defeat| Loss |
|:----------------:|:--:|:----------------:|:----:|
|0|1|0|1|
|1|2|1|2|
|2|3|2|3|
|3|4|3|4|
|4|5|4|5|

#### 5.4.11.3 Exhaustion

If your resolve becomes **exhausted** (reaches *zero* resolve), you return to play with your starting **resolve** permanently reduced by *one*. This is the impact of trauma on your reserves to cope with further stresses.

When your starting **resolve** becomes *zero* your PC succumbs to the strains of an adventurous life and must retire from play, perhaps dead, perhaps in exile, perhaps incapacitated. It is time to create a new character.

You might decide to retire your PC earlier - as your starting **resolve** lowers your PC's ability to cope with a life of adventure diminishes.
