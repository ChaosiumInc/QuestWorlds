## 5.4 Chained Sequence

A **Chained Sequence** consists of one or more **rounds**; each **round** is a **contest**.

In a **chained contest** there is no *tally*, instead your GM applies the **consequences** to the loser in the **contest** immediately following a **round**. This leads to a grittier feel to the **contest**, but at the price of a 'death spiral.' Once you lose the **consequences** make it likelier that you will lose again. **Chained Sequences** tend to produce the most extreme **outcomes**, as participants tend to accumulate significant **consequences**.

In a **chained sequence** each **round** represents attempts by both parties to overcome their opponent.

Your GM should determine who has the initiative to describe what they are doing for any **round**, based on their interpretation of the flow of events. If in doubt your GM should defer to you over your opponent to describe what you do in the **round**, and describe the NPC reacting to that.

### 5.4.1 Immediate Consequences

Apply  **consequences** (see §2.6) with immediate effect to the loser, according to the **outcome** of that **round's** **contest**. Use the **degree** to assess the **consequences** (see §2.8).

**Chained sequences** are asymmetric, in that they accumulate **consequences** for the loser, and not **benefits** for the winner. Your GM may decide to award **benefits** to a victorious PC after the **sequence** ends (see §2.6).

After **consequences** have been applied, you decide if you wish to continue the **chained sequence** or if you wish to **disengage**, and your GM makes a similar determination for the **resistance**. Both you and your GM then express your intent.

If the **penalties** suffered by one contestant reduce their **ability** below *zero*, they must concede the contest. If it makes sense, your GM may allow you to continue by switching **abilities**. Accumulated **penalties** apply to the new ability used in the contest - this may still force you to concede.

#### 5.4.2 Followers in a Chained Sequence

**Followers** may augment your character in a **chained sequence**. In addition, if you suffer a **defeat** in a **round** of a **chained sequence** you may transfer that **outcome** to a **follower**. Doing so takes that **follower** out of further **rounds** of the **chained sequence**.

### 5.4.3 Group Chained Sequence Outcomes

In a **group chained sequence** the side that has not conceded gains the **prize**.

Individual **consequences** or **benefits** will have already been determined by the **chained sequence** **outcomes** on each **round**.

### 5.4.4 Parting Shot

If you drive your opponent's **TN** below *zero* you are eligible for a **parting shot**. The **parting shot** is another contest against your **defeated** opponent. The **ability** you use must relate to the **consequences** the opposition will suffer, but needn’t be the same one you used to win the **contest**. If the loser is a PC they use a suitable **ability** to resist; otherwise the GM rolls a suitable **resistance** value.

If you succeed in your **parting shot** roll, you inflict additional immediate **consequences** against your opponent, worsening their position.

However, if your opponent succeeds, they use the **benefits** they would accrue on a **victory**, and subtract them from the number of **consequences** scored against them. If this returns their **TN** above *zero* they may re-enter the **sequence**. Your GM describes this as a dramatic turnaround, in which your overreaching has somehow granted them an advantage allowing them to recover from their previous misfortune.

### 5.3.6 Assists

You may either **augment** a teammate to improve their **TN** or 'heal' some of their existing **consequences** (see §2.8.3).

### 5.3.7  Joining an In-Progress Contest

Any **consequences** that you have in effect, or participants in the in-progress **sequence** you are joining have, remain in effect.
