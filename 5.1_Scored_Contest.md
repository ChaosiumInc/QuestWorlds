## 5.1 Scored Contest

**Scored contests** are longer and more dramatic than **simple contests**. Your GM uses **scored contests** when the **outcome** of the struggle is important, to generate suspense for you, or when your GM want a back-and-forth struggle. It is something you and your GM should visualize and describe.

A **scored contest** consists of one or more **rounds**, in which you perform actions that are similar to **simple contests**. However, actions and **rounds** do not decide the **outcome** of the whole **contest**, only who gains or loses **resolution points** at that time. In a **scored contest** there is no distinction between aggressor and defender, each **round** represents attempts by both parties to overcome their opponent. Your GM should determine who has the initiative to describe what they are doing for any **exchange**, based on their interpretation of the flow of events. If in doubt your GM should defer to you over your opponent to describe what you do in the **round**, and describe the NPC reacting to that.

### 5.1.1 Procedure

1. Your GM **frames the contest**.
2. You choose a **tactic**, and figure your PC's **target number** (**TN**) using the **score** of your **ability**, plus or minus **modifiers** the GM may give you.
3. Your GM determines the **resistance**. If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their **TN** as described in step 2.
4. Carry out one or more **rounds**, repeating as necessary.
    1. A **scored contest** unfolds as a series of **simple contests**. At the end of each **simple contest**, the winner scores a number of **resolution points (RPs)** to their tally, which varies between 1 and 5, depending on the **result**. Tied **results** leave the score unchanged.
    2. Your GM decides which opponent has the initiative and describes what they are trying to do to achieve the **prize**, the 'aggressor'. The 'defender' describes how they counter the aggressor's attempt to seize the **prize**. If it is not obvious from the unfolding narrative, your GM should choose your PC as the 'aggressor'.
    3. Conduct a **simple contest** as normal, but once the **outcome** has been determined, it becomes a number of **resolution points** scored by the winning side.
    4. The number of **resolution points** the winner garners at the end of each **round** depends on the difference in their **results**, (see below).
    5. The first to accumulate a total of 5 **resolution points** wins; their opponent is knocked out of the **contest** and loses the **prize**.
5. Determine the **scored contest outcome** based on **rising action** or **climax** (below). Award **experience points** if appropriate (see §8.1).
6. Determine **benefits** or **consequences**.
7. Describe the **outcome** based on the **story obstacle**.

Unlike in an **extended contest** (see below), where you usually take part in two **exchanges** with your opponent per **round** (one in which you choose the **AP bid**, and one in which your opponent does), here you and your opponent engage in a single **exchange** per **round** (in which whoever the GM determines has initiative describes an action to seize the **prize** and their opponent how they intend to stop them).

#### 5.1.2 Resolution Points

* You score one **resolution point** if you have a better roll on the same result.
* You score two **resolution points** for one level of difference, such as **success** vs. **failure**, or **critical** vs. **success**.
* You score three  **resolution points** for two level of difference such as **success** vs **fumble**, or **critical** vs. **failure**
* You score four  **resolution points** for three levels of difference, which is a **critical** vs. **fumble**.

You can summarize this as: one more **resolution point** than the levels of difference between the **results**.

Your **resolution point** score tells you how well you’re doing, relative to your opponent, in the ebb and flow of a fluid, suspenseful conflict. If you’re leading your opponent by 0–4, you’re giving them a thorough pasting. If you’re behind 4–0, you’re on your last legs, while your opponent has had an easy time of it. If you’re tied, you’ve each been getting in some good licks.

In a fight, scoring 1 **RP** might mean that you hit your opponent with a grazing blow, or knocked him into an awkward position.

Scoring 2 **RPs** might mean a palpable hit, most likely with bone-crunching sound effects.

A 3 **RP** hit sends them reeling, and, depending on the realism level of the genre, may be accompanied by a spray of blood.

However, the exact physical harm you’ve dished out to them remains unclear until the **contest's** end. When that happens, the real effects of your various **victories** become suddenly apparent. Perhaps they stagger, merely dazed, up against a wall. Maybe they fall over dead.

In a debate, a 1 **RP** might occasion mild head nodding from spectators, or a frown on your opponent’s face.

2 **RPs** would occasion mild applause from onlookers, or send a flush to your opponent’s face.

On 3 **RPs**, your opponent might be thrown completely off-track, as audience members wince at the force of your devastating verbal jab.

In interpreting the individual **simple contests** within a **scored contest**, your GM is guided by two principles:

1. No consequence is certain until the entire **scored contest** is over.
2. When a character scores points, it can reflect any positive change in fortunes, not just the most obvious one.

### 5.1.3 Scored Contest Outcomes

In a **scored contest** the contestant that is the first to gain a total of 5 **resolution points** gains the **prize**.

Your GM may treat the difference in **resource points** as a measure of the magnitude of your **victory** or **defeat**. A 5-0 **outcome** is far more decisive than a 5-4 **outcome** for example.

Your GM may apply **consequences** and **benefits** as they see fit. The **scale** of those **consequences** and **benefits** may be guided by the difference in **resolution points** between the two sides.

### 5.1.4 Parting Shot

In the **round** immediately after you take an opponent out of the **contest**, you may attempt to gain another **prize** from your opponent by engaging in a **parting shot**. This is an attempt (metaphoric or otherwise) to kick your opponent while he’s down:

* Striking an incapacitated enemy
* Attacking a retreating army
* Attaching one more punitive rider to a legal settlement
* Demanding additional money from a business partner
* Delivering one last humiliating insult

You should agree an additional **prize** that you desire beyond the stakes agreed at the beginning of the contest. If you succeed in a **parting shot** you will also gain that prize. Your GM should agree that the additional **prize** makes sense as an opportunity brought about by your opponent's **defeat**.

Your GM should not use a **parting shot**.

The **parting shot** is another simple contest against your **defeated** opponent. The **ability** you use must relate to the consequences the opposition will suffer, but needn’t be the same one you used to win the **contest**. If the loser is a PC they use a suitable **ability** to resist; otherwise the GM rolls a suitable **resistance** value.

If you succeed in your **parting shot** roll, you gain the additional **prize**.

However, if your opponent succeeds, they take the number of **resolution points** they would, in a standard **round**, score against you, and instead subtracts them from the number of **resolution points** scored against them in the **round** that removed them from the **contest**. If the revised total is now less than 5 **RPs**, they return to the **contest**, and may re-engage you. Your GM describes this as a dramatic turnaround, in which your overreaching has somehow granted them an advantage allowing them to recover from their previous misfortune. The provisional consequences they suffered now go away, and are treated as a momentary or seeming disadvantage.

Where it makes sense, unengaged PCs may attempt **parting shots** against opponents taken out of the **contest** by someone else. You may not revive your teammates by using your lamest abilities to make **parting shots** on them; this, by definition, does not pass a **credibility test**.

### 5.1.5 Asymmetrical Round

You may choose to briefly suspend your attempt to best your opponent in a **scored contest**, in order to do something else. An instance where you are trying to do something else and your opponent is trying to win the **contest** is called an **asymmetrical round**.

In an **asymmetrical round**, you do not score **RPs** against your opponent if you win the **round**. Instead, you succeed at whatever else you were doing. You still lose **RPs** if you fail. Often you will be using an **ability** other than the one you've been waging the **contest** with, one better suited to the task at hand. This becomes additionally dangerous when the **score** associated with your substitute **ability** is significantly lower than the one used for the rest of the **contest**.

In addition to secondary objectives, as in the above example, you may engage in **asymmetrical round** to grant **augments** (see above) to yourself or others.

### 5.1.6 Disengaging

You can always abandon a **contest**, but, in addition to failing at the **story obstacle**, you may also suffer negative consequences. In a **contest** where your opponent intends to harm you, you will always suffer negative consequences if you withdraw, unless you successfully disengage.

To disengage, you make an **asymmetrical round**, using the **ability** relevant to the **contest** you’re trying to wriggle out of.

If you fail, your effort is wasted and the score against you increases, as it would have during a normal **round**. If you succeed, you escape the clutches, literal or metaphorical, of your opponent, without further harm from a **contest** during the **rising action**. In a **climactic** scene, however, **RPs** scored during **contests** you disengaged from are still taken into account when determining **consequences**. In the case of a **group contest**, **consequences** against you are determined as soon as you disengage.
