## 4.3 Multiple Contestants, One Prize

Sometimes, there can be only one. When you are in a contest with multiple contenders, but only one of you can win the **prize**, you have to beat everyone else. Typical examples include athletic contests, beauty contests, a game show, or an election.

When you compete for a single **prize** you compare your **result** with the other contestants. Your GM should find the highest number of **successes** obtained by any of the contestants. If there is only one contestant with that number, the GM awards them the **prize**. Otherwise, your GM will compare the **rolls** of everyone who shares that number of successes. The contestant with the highest **roll** wins the **prize**. If two contestants match on the highest **roll**, then the **contest** finishes in a **tie**, and the winners must share the **prize**. If sharing the **prize** does not make sense, then your GM awards it, in order of preference, to the highest **ability**, a **PC** over an **NPC**, GM's choice.

It is possible that all the contestants lose. In this case, the GM needs to decide if it possible for no one to win, because they failed to finish the race or did not answer the questions in the final round of the game show. If they cannot fail to win, it goes to the highest roll, as above.

Use a **simple contest** when you have multiple contenders for a single **prize** over a **long contest** (see §5.0).

### 4,3,1 Procedure

Multiple contestants and one prize can be summarized as follows:

1. Find the highest number of **successes** amongst the participants.
2. If only one contestant has that number of **successes** amongst the players, award them the **prize**.
3. If multiple contestants share that number of **successes** the contestant with the highest **roll** wins the prize.
4. If two or more contestants match on the highest **roll**, there is a **tie** and the contestants with the matching **roll** share the **prize**.
5. If the **prize** cannot be shared then award to in order: highest **ability**, a **PC** over an **NPC**, GM's choice.
