## 2.10 Mobs, Gangs, and Hordes

Sometimes you will be outnumbered by your opponents. Your GM can treat many as one. Your GM treats a crowd as a single **resistance** with one **rating**. When selecting a **resistance** your GM should factor their numbers into the **rating**. Numbers are not always an advantage. Whilst in a fight, numbers give you a significant advantage - provided the mob has room to maneuver - in an attempt to win 'hearts and minds' too many voices can be counterproductive, unless you are trying to intimidate. The final decision on the amount of help provided by numerical advantage rests with your GM.

In a sequence, when the mob loses an exchange, your GM describes individuals within it as being hurt or falling away. When it wins, they describe them overwhelming you.
