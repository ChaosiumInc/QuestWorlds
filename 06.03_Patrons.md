## 6.3 Patrons

**Patrons** enjoy greater access to assets than you, either through personal ownership (as in a wealthy entrepreneur or rich aristocrat) or authority (as in the governor of a state or province or the head of an organization). They may lend you advice or provide you with assets but are too busy and important to personally perform tasks for you. They may hire you to do jobs, or issue orders within a command structure to which you both belong.  

When you roll your **patron** relationship, your GM adjusts the resistance class depending on what you have done for them lately.
