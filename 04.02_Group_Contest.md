## 4.2 Group Contest

In the **group contest**, multiple participants take part in a **contest**. Each of you in your group conducts an individual **contest** against the GM, and the **outcomes** for each side are collated to determine the victor.

A **group contest** may pit all of you against a single **resistance**, representing one **story obstacle** or **story question**.  Alternatively, a **group contest** may be a series of paired match-ups between two groups of contestants. If you are forced to participate in more than one **contest**, then you face the standard multiple opponent **penalties**.

### 4.2.1 Procedure

A **group contest** can be summarized as follows:

1. Your GM **frames the contest**.
2. You choose a **tactic**. Your **target number (TN)** is your **rating**, adding any **augments** (see §2.6), **hindrances** (see §2.7), **stretches** and **situational modifiers** (see §2.5), **consequences** and **benefits** (see §2.8).
3. Your GM determines the **resistance**.  If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their **TN** as described in step 2.
4. For each of your group, roll a D20 vs your relevant **ability**, while your GM rolls a D20 vs the **resistance**. Your GM compares the difference **successes** between the two rolls to assesses the individual **outcome** (see §2.4.7).
5. The side with the highest number of **successes** is the overall victor in the **contest**. Award **experience points** if appropriate (see §8.1).
6. Describe the **outcome** based on the agreed **prize**. If you need to determine the **degree** of **victory** or **defeat** for the PCs, divide the difference in **successes** by the number of **PCs** rounding down. For example: if there are 4 PCs and they win by six **successes** they gain 6/4 or *one* **degree** of **victory**; if there are 4 PCs and they lose by three **successes** they lose by 3/4 or *zero* **degrees** of victory.

It is possible that you suffer a **defeat**, even though your side gains the **victory**. It is possible that, as a result, that your PC will suffer a **consequence** (see §2.8) related to your **defeat**, even though your side won. If your side loses, then you may suffer both a **consequence** for your own individual **contest**, and a **consequence** for the overall **contest**.

It is possible that you gain a **victory**, even though your side suffers a **defeat**. It is possible that, as a result, that your PC will obtain a **benefit** (see §2.8) related to your **victory**, even though your side lost. If your side won, then you may gain both a **benefit** for your own individual **contest**, and a **benefit** for the overall **contest**.
