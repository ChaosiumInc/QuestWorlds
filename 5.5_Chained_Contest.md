## 5.5 Chained Contest

**Chained contests** do not defer **consequences** to the end of the **contest**, instead your GM applies the **consequences** to the loser in the **contest** immediately following a **round**. This leads to a grittier feel to the **contest**, but at the price of a death spiral: once you lose the **consequences** make it likelier that you will lose again. **Chained contests** tend to produce the most extreme **outcomes**, as participants tend to accumulate significant **consequences**.

To run an **chained contest** your GM runs a **simple contest** as normal, and then applies  **consequences** (see §2.6) with immediate effect. A **chained contest** benefits from using the **rank** when assessing the **consequences** (see §2.8).

**Chained contests** are asymmetric, in that they accumulate **consequences** for the loser, and not **benefits** for the winner. Your GM may decide to award **benefits** to a victorious PC after the **contest** ends (see §2.6).

You decide if you wish to continue the **chained contest**, and your GM makes a similar determination for the **resistance**. Both you and your GM then express your intent. If your or your GM wishes to continue, play out another **simple contest**. If you, or your GM, wishes to **disengage**, then on a **victory** you leave the contest, without inflicting consequences on the opposition. If both you and the GM wish to leave the contest, then you both **disengage**, and the contest ends.

If you **disengage** you do not gain the **prize** and suffer **defeat**, unless both sides **disengaged** which is a **tie** and neither gets the **prize**.

You can switch **abilities** within the contest, provided your GM agrees that the new **ability** represents a suitable **tactic** to obtain the **prize**.

If the **penalties** suffered by one contestant reduce their **ability** below 0, they must concede the contest. If it makes sense, your GM may allow you to continue by switching **abilities**. The GM may decide that accumulated **penalties** apply to the new ability used in the contest - this may still force you to concede.

Award **experience points** if appropriate (see §8.1).

### 5.5.1 Group Chained Contest

In a **group chained contest** opponents pair off and fight a series of **chained contest** **rounds** with each other.

Your GM should determine the order of action, but as all rounds represent actions by both aggressor and defender there is no advantage to be obtained by going first. If there are surplus characters on your side, you may engage an already engaged opponent in a second **contest**; your GM may choose to apply a **penalty** to them as they are already engaged with one opponent. Alternatively you may choose to **augment** an existing player character, reflecting aiding them in their fight instead.

### 5.5.2 Group Chained Contest Outcomes

In a **group chained contest** the side that has not conceded gains the **prize**.

Individual **consequences** or **benefits** will have already been determined by the **chained contest** **outcomes** on each **round**.

### 5.5.3 Followers in a Chained Contest

**Followers** may augment your character in a **chained contest**.

In addition, if you suffer a defeat in a round of a **chained contest** you may transfer that **outcome** to a follower, but they suffer a **state of adversity** one level worse than you would do, so marginal becomes minor etc., and the **follower** is removed from the **contest**.
