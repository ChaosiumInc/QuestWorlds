## 3.4 Assigning Ability Ratings

You have now defined your **abilities** and **flaws**. These tell everyone what you can do.

Now assign numbers to each **ability**, called **ratings**, which determine how well you can do these things.

Assign a starting **rating** of 15 to the **ability** you find most important or defining. Although most players consider it wisest to assign this **rating** to their **occupational keyword**, you donâ€™t have to do this. Assign a **rating** of 15 to your **distinguishing characteristic**.

All other **abilities** start at a **rating** of 10.

A **breakout** from a **keyword** starts at +5. In some cases, you may treat your **distinguishing characteristic** as a **breakout ability** from a **keyword** in this case, treat it as a +10.

**Flaws** are assigned a **rating** equivalent to your **abilities**. The first **flaw** is rated at the highest **ability**, the second shares the same **rating** as the second-highest **ability**, and the third equals the lowest **ability**. All **flaws** after the third are given the same **rating** as the lowest **ability**. You may designate **flaws** from **keywords** as your first or second-ranked **flaw**.

Now, you get 30 **improvement points** to spend to improve your **abilities**. Each **improvement point** increases an ability by +1. You can spend up to ten **improvement points** on an ability. You cannot increase a **breakout** with **improvement points**. The maximum starting **ability rating** is 5M.

You can spend **improvement points** after a roll, so as to **succeed** and no **fail**.

Some genre packs may require you to have additional **keywords** that reflect the setting. These additional **keywords** come from the 12 **abilities** allowance, so in many genres you will have fewer wildcard **abilities** but better fit the setting.
