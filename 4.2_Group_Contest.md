## 4.2 Group Contest

In the **group contest**, multiple participants take part in a **contest**. Each of you in your group conducts an individual **contest** against the GM, and the **outcomes** for each side are collated to determine the victor.

A **group contest** may pit all of you against a single **resistance**, representing one **story obstacle** or **story question**.  Alternatively, a **group contest** may be a series of paired match-ups between two groups of contestants. If your PC is matched against multiple opponents, your GM should consider increasing the resistance instead of rolling multiple times (see Mobs, Gangs, and Hordes §2.12). If the resistance is forced to face off against multiple PCs the GM should consider, lowering the resistance (see Ganging Up §2.11).

### 4.2.1 Procedure

A **group contest** can be summarized as follows:

1. Your GM **frames the contest**.
2. You choose a **tactic**. Your **target number (TN)** is your **rating**, adding any **augments** (see §2.6), **hindrances** (see §2.7), **stretches** and **situational modifiers** (see §2.5), **consequences** and **benefits** (see §2.8).
3. Your GM determines the **resistance**.  If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their **TN** as described in step 2.
4. For each of your group
    1. Roll a D20 vs your relevant **ability**, while your GM rolls a D20 vs the **resistance**. Determine the **degree** of **victory** or **defeat** for the individual PC from the **outcome** (see §2.4.7).
    2. Add the number of **successes** scored in the contest to a running total of **successes** for each group, regardless of the individual **outcome**. **Victory** or **defeat**, **successes** count towards the group **outcome**.
    3. Award **experience points** if appropriate (see §8.1).
5. The side with the highest number of **successes** is the overall victor in the **contest**. Award **experience points** if appropriate (see §8.1). If the number of **successes** is tied the contest ends in a stalemate, with neither side gaining control of the **prize**.
6. Determine **degree of victory** from the difference between the **successes** scored by each side.
7. Describe the **outcome** based on the agreed **prize**.

If the result is a tie, but it does not make sense for there to be no outcome, then award the PCs group a *zero* **degree victory**

It is possible that you suffer a **defeat**, even though your side gains the **victory**. It is possible that, as a result, that your PC will suffer a **consequence** (see §2.8) related to your **defeat**, even though your side won. If your side loses, then you may suffer both a **consequence** for your own individual **contest**, and a **consequence** for the overall **contest**.

It is possible that you gain a **victory**, even though your side suffers a **defeat**. It is possible that, as a result, that your PC will obtain a **benefit** (see §2.8) related to your **victory**, even though your side lost. If your side won, then you may gain both a **benefit** for your own individual **contest**, and a **benefit** for the overall **contest**.
