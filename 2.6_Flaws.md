## 2.6 Flaws

During play your GM may decide that your **flaw** has been triggered. A **flaw** might apply to the **tactic** you are using in upcoming **contest**, when it is called a **hindrance** (see §2.6.1). Alternatively a **flaw** might simply come into play when you want to describe your PC acting in a certain way, and your GM feels that one of your **flaws** could prevent this, or your GM feels that a situation raises a challenge that means one of your **flaw** means would lead to you responding in a certain way. (see §2.6.2).

When you experience a **penalty** due to a flaw, you gain an **experience point** (see §8.1).

### 2.6.1 Hindrance

if you describe a **tactic** for a **contest** that is in conflict with a **flaw**, your GM may decide to impose a **penalty** called a **hindrance** against you in the upcoming **contest**. Your GM may also use an **ability** on your character sheet against you in this way too, if appropriate. This may be the case for relationships you have, philosophies you espouse, or groups you belong to. Your GM should trigger a **hindrance** from a **keyword** more frequently than from a stand-alone **ability** that is not a **flaw**. Your GM may treat their use of an **keyword** as a **flaw** as a **stretch** when invoking it.

Your GM should follow a similar approach to **augments** when applying a **hindrance** (see §2.5). They should ask themselves if it is *fresh*, *interesting* or *illuminates character*. In a movie of book would your **flaw** be prominent here?

If your GM feels that there is no uncertainty as to whether the **flaw** applies to your **tactic** in the contest they apply a **penalty** of -3 or -6 depending on how serious a handicap the **flaw** is. (This is, in effect a reverse **assured contest** in the GM's favor). You may also suggest to the GM that you feel the **flaw** would apply without a contest.

If your GM feels that it is uncertain as to whether the **flaw** hinders you, or you are able to overcome it, and you agree that you wish to try, treat it as a **simple contest**. Roll the rating of your **flaw** against the **base resistance**. On a **victory**, you receive a **penalty** of -3 or -6 depending on how significant a **hindrance** your GM feels the flaw is to your **tactic**. On a **defeat**, you overcome the **flaw**. You may want to describe how you overcome your **flaw** to use your **tactic**.

### 2.6.2 Act according to your flaw

At times the direction of the story you are all telling may place your PC in situations when it seems likely they would act according to their **flaw**. The addict may reach for drink or drugs following an emotional setback, a lust for vengeance may come between your PC and showing mercy, prejudices or bigotry may prevent your from seeing others positively.  

If you chose to act according to your **flaw** there is no contest, simply describe your character behaving as the **flaw** dictates. This might result in a **hindrance** to further actions (see §2.6.1)

If you wish to act against your **flaw**, your **tactic** must pass a **credibility test** as to how you try overcome your **flaw** in this instance. Then you must obtain a **victory** in a **simple contest** against your **flaw**. On a **victory** you may act in a way that contradicts your **flaw**.

If you submit to your **flaw**, your GM might impose a **hindrance** on further actions (see §2.6.1). You should not resist this **hindrance** unless the situation is not related to the one which triggered your **flaw** in this instance, or significant time has now passed.

Your GM may impose a **penalty** even if you gain the **victory** against your **flaw** representing your struggle against your inner nature or letting down dependents.
 
Similarly, your GM might give you a **bonus** for acting according to your **flaw**. representing the sacrifices you have made for dependents or a temporary boost from satisfying your inner demons.

If your GM compels you to act according to your **flaw**, you gain an **experience point** (see §8.1).
