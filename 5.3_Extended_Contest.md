## 5.3 Extended Contest

**Extended contests** are longer and more dramatic than **simple contests**. Your GM uses **extended contests** when the **outcome** of the struggle is important, to generate suspense for the players, or when they want a back-and-forth struggle. It is something you and your GM should visualize and describe.

An **extended contest** consists of one or more **rounds**, in which you perform actions that are similar to **simple contests**. However, actions and **rounds** do not decide the **outcome** of the whole **contest**, only who gains or loses **advantage points (AP)** at that time. You take actions in turn, an **exchange**, losing and gaining the advantage, until either you or your opponent runs out of **advantage points** and is **defeated**.

### 5.3.1 Procedure

1. Your GM **frames the contest**.
2. You choose a **tactic**, and figure your PC's **target number** (**TN**) using the **score** of your **ability**, plus or minus **modifiers** the GM may give you. Figure your starting **advantage point (AP)** total (see §5.3.2.1).
3. The GM determines the **resistance**. The GM opposes the PC with a **resistance**—the harder the task or tougher the opponent, the higher the **resistance**. The GM figures starting **APs** for the **resistance** (see §5.3.2.1).
4. Carry out one or more **rounds**, repeating as necessary.
    1. Each **round** consists of two **exchanges**: an action and immediate response.
        1. You describe your action towards the desired **prize** and bid **APs** *(see §5.3.2.2).
        2. Roll a die to determine your **result**, then apply any **bumps**. Your GM does the same.
        3. Compare the results of the two **results** to determine who loses **AP**; only when you have a **critical** can you gain **AP** from your opponent. (see §5.3.2.3)
        4. If either contestant reaches 0 **advantage points** or fewer, the contest is over.
        5. The GM then hazards a number of **APs** for the **resistance**. 
        6. Roll a die to determine your **result**, then apply any **bumps**. Your GM does the same.
        7. Compare the results of the two **results** to determine who loses **AP**; only when you have a **critical** can you gain **AP** from your opponent. (see §5.3.2.3).
        8. If either contestant reaches 0 **advantage points** or fewer, the contest is over.
5. Award **experience points** if appropriate (see §8.1).

### 5.3.2 Advantage Points

#### 5.3.2.1 Starting AP Totals

You describe your action towards the desired **prize** and what **ability** you use. The **ability** used in the contest can be varied, but **APs** are always calculated on the first **ability** that you use in a contest. That **ability** must be used in the first **round**. Figure your starting **advantage point (AP)** total using the **TN**, including all **modifiers** and **augments**. The **AP** include +20 for each level of **mastery**, and can also be increased by **followers**.

The GM figures starting **APs** for the **resistance** from the **resistance** **TN**.

#### 5.3.2.2  Bidding Advantage Points

You gamble a number of your **APs** in an attempt to reduce your opponent’s **AP**, but if you fail the attempt you lose the **AP**.

You describe your action towards the desired **prize**, what **ability** you use, and how much risk you take. “I want to climb straight up to that outcrop, taking chances if needed.” You can specify your **AP bid**; if you do not, your GM determines this based on the amount of risk you are taking.

The size of the **bid** mirrors how bold and risky your character’s action is. Extreme or aggressive actions mean a high **AP bid**, and cautious actions require less. If you describe an all-out offensive with your sword cutting vicious arcs, you need to bid a lot of **APs**; if you say that you are circling your foe cautiously, a low **bid** is in order. Your GM  will look at the level of risk you are taking, and may suggest that you change your **bid** to better match your actions. If you do not declare a **bid** before rolling the die, your GM will decide how many points are **bid** (using 3 as a default), with riskier actions calling for higher **AP bids**.

#### 5.3.2.3 Losing Advantage Points

The number of advantage points lost by a contestant is a multiplier of their bid. Determine the multiplier used as follows:

* On a tie, both contestants lose ½x bid. Round up.
* If the loser had the same result, but a worse roll, they lose ½x bid. Round up.
* If the loser had one level of difference, such as **success** vs **failure** or **failure** vs **fumble**, they lose 1x their bid.
* If the loser had two levels of difference, such as **success** vs **fumble**, they lose 2x their bid.
* if the loser has three levels of difference, a **critical** vs **fumble**, they lose 3x their bid.
* If the winner has a **critical**, the **APs** lost by the loser are gained by the winner - a transfer.

#### 5.3.2.4  Followers and Advantage Points

**Followers** can act in different ways during a **contest**, **augmenting** you with their **abilities** or allowing you to use one of your **abilities** as if it were your own. Alternatively, a **follower** with a relevant **ability** or **keyword** can simply add their **APs** to the PC’s at the beginning of the **contest**.

Remember to figure any **modifiers** into your **follower’s** **ability** before adding it to your starting **AP** total.

Neither you nor the GM makes rolls for **followers**. Instead, their actions are subsumed into yours. The **follower’s** relevant **ability** or **keyword** is used solely as a source of **advantage points**.

You can assign your **followers** to someone else, although you may have to succeed at a contest to persuade a reluctant follower to go along.

#### 5.3.2.5 Advantage Point Knowledge

Once your opponent has won or lost **APs** during the current contest, you can ask the GM what the opposition's **AP** total is. This is where the element of skill comes in. When choosing how many **APs** to stake, you must weigh the effect they want to gain if you succeed versus the risk you face if the action fails.

#### 5.3.2.6 Advantage Point Recalculation

**Advantage points** are only relevant for the length of a particular **contest**. Your PC does not have any until the next **extended contest** begins, when you calculate them all over again.

### 5.3.3 Extended Contest Outcomes

When your GM determines **consequences** and **benefits** they can use the final **AP** totals

In a **group extended contest** the side that has the last undefeated contestant gains the **prize**.

Your GM may apply **consequences** and **benefits** as they see fit. The **scale** of those **consequences** and **benefits** may be guided by the difference in **action points** between the two sides.

### 5.3.4 Parting Shot

When you **defeat** an opponent in an **extended contest**, you can act again immediately to try to make their **consequences** more severe. This is called a **parting shot**. 

In the **round** immediately after you take an opponent out of the **contest**, you may attempt to gain another **prize** from your opponent suffers by engaging in a **parting shot**. This is an attempt (metaphoric or otherwise) to kick your opponent while he’s down:

* Striking an incapacitated enemy
* Attacking a retreating army
* Attaching one more punitive rider to a legal settlement
* Demanding additional money from a business partner
* Delivering one last humiliating insult

You should agree an additional **prize** that you desire beyond the stakes agreed at the beginning of the contest. If you succeed in a **parting shot** you will also gain that **prize**. Your GM should agree that the additional **prize** makes sense as an opportunity brought about by your opponent's **defeat**.

Your GM should not use a **parting shot**.

You once again **bid** **AP** and use an appropriate **ability** against your opponent. Your GM must agree that the size of your **AP** **bid** is sufficient to gain the additional **prize**. The greater the **prize** the more risk that failure will bring them back into the contest, and so the higher the **bid** must be. If you succeed, their **AP** will decrease; their **outcome** may or may not change, but they cannot finish the **round** by taking an action against you.

**Parting shots** are risky; if you fail, an **AP** transfer might bring your opponent back into the **contest**. Your stumble can give them an opening that they can exploit in an effort to snatch **victory** from the jaws of **defeat**.

### 5.3.5 Desperation Stake

You can stake more **advantage points** than you currently have, to a maximum of your starting **AP** total. This allows you to attempt a **desperation stake** even when you are within a single **AP** of **defeat**. Your GM can never stake more **advantage points** than they have.

### 5.3.6 Asymmetrical Exchange

If you are engaged, you may choose to briefly suspend your attempt to best your opponent in an **extended contest**, in order to do something else. An instance where you are trying to do something else and your opponent is trying to win the **contest** is called an **asymmetrical exchange**.

In an **asymmetrical exchange**, you do not score **APs** against your opponent if you win the **exchange**. Instead, you succeed at whatever else you were doing. You still lose **AP** if you fail. Often you will be using an **ability** other than the one you've been waging the **contest** with, one better suited to the task at hand. This becomes additionally dangerous when the **score** associated with your substitute **ability** is significantly lower than the one used for the rest of the **contest**.

In addition to secondary objectives, as in the above example, you may engage in **asymmetrical exchange** to grant **augments** (see §2.5) to yourself or others.

### 5.3.7 Switching Abilities

You can usually switch freely from one **ability** to another in the middle of an **extended contest**. It makes sense to do so if you think a different **ability** will yield an advantage. 

Your **AP** total stays the same when you change your **ability**, so it makes sense to start the contest with your best **ability** (appropriate to your goal, of course). If this seems odd, remember that **advantage points** measure advantage—how well the character is doing in the contest at the current moment. They do not measure proficiency; that is what the **target number** is for.

When you switch **abilities**, your **prize** does not change, just the means by which you pursue it.

### 5.3.6 Disengaging

To disengage from an **extended contest** when your opponent is actively trying to keep you in the conflict, use an **asymmetrical exchange** (see ±5.3.6). You use an **ability** relevant to your attempt to disengage; the opponent counters with the **resistance** or, if a PC, an appropriate **ability**. If the GM attempts to disengage, they use the **resistance** to do so. These **abilities** may or may not be those used in the main **contest**.

On any **victory**, you are able to leave the **contest**. 

If you withdraw from a **group extended contest** and later decide to rejoin it (or are forced to), you rejoin with the **advantage point** total you had when you left. If you can show how your leaving and returning substantially changes the situation, the GM may restore some of your **AP**—for example, if you leave a street fight to get your **followers** from a nearby tavern. Leaving a **contest** just to pick up a weapon or catch your breath is an **unrelated action**, and does not change your **advantage points**.

### 5.3.12 AP Gifting

If you are uninvolved in the contest you can also increase a participant’s **AP** total. First, agree the **tactic** you are using to help the engaged participant. Second, figure your **APs** from that ability (see ±5.3.2.1). You **bid** a number of **APs** which may not exceed your **target number**. The **resistance** is twice the **bid**. 

On a **victory** you transfer that number of the participant. On a **defeat** you transfer that number to the participant's opponent.

### 5.3.13 Edges and Handicaps

Your GM may want rules to represent opponents who strike rarely but with great effect or who strike often but with little impact per blow. The first quality can be represented with an **edge**; the second, with a **handicap**. **Edges** and **handicaps** are designated using ^ (^5, for example), **handicaps** with a minus sign (–^5).

**Edges** and **handicaps** affect only the **advantage points bid** in an **extended contest**. Your **edge** is added to your **AP bid** when your opponent must **lose** or **transfer APs**. Your **handicap** is subtracted from your bid when your opponent **loses** or **transfers APs**. A contestant’s **edge** or **handicap** never affects his **AP** when he defends, only when he is attacking.

Most GMs find **edges** and **handicaps** more trouble than they’re worth, and depict these phenomena with description alone. Earlier books made more extensive use of **edges** and **handicaps** to represent the quality of equipment carried by the PCs. In games where restricted access to equipment is a significant part of the setting and your GM wants to use extended contests it may make sense to use them, otherwise we recommend ignoring them.
