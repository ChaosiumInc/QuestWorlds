## 5.3 Extended Contest

An **extended contest** consists of one or more **rounds**, in which you perform **contests**. We *tally* the position of the contestants in **advantage points (AP)**. Once a contestant reach *zero* or fewer **APs** they lose that **extended contest**.

 In a **round** *both* you and your opponent take actions in turn, an **exchange**. Each **exchange** is a **contest** so you have a pair for any **round**. If a contestant falls below *zero* **APs** as a result of their opponent's **exchange**, they immediately lose, and do not get to conduct their own **exchange**. Your GM should determine who has the initiative to describe what they are doing for any **exchange**, the 'aggressor', based on their interpretation of the flow of events. The aggressor describes their action, and wagers a matching number of **APs**. The defender then describes their response and wages a matching number of **APs**.

 These **exchanges** are then conducted in order of the highest bid first.

### 5.3.1 Advantage Points

#### 5.3.1.1 Starting AP Totals

You describe your action towards the desired **prize** and what **ability** you use. The **ability** used in the contest can be varied, but **APs** are always calculated on the first **ability** that you use in a contest. That **ability** must be used in the first **round**. Figure your starting **advantage point (AP)** total using the **TN**. The **AP** include +20 for each level of **mastery**, and can also be increased by **followers**.

The GM figures starting **APs** for the **resistance** from the **resistance** **TN**.

#### 5.3.1.2  Bidding Advantage Points

You gamble a number of your **APs** in an attempt to reduce your opponent’s **AP**, but if you fail the attempt you lose the **AP**.

You describe your action towards the desired **prize**, what **ability** you use, and how much risk you take. “I want to climb straight up to that outcrop, taking chances if needed.” You can specify your **AP bid**; if you do not, your GM determines this based on the amount of risk you are taking.

The size of the **bid** mirrors how bold and risky your character’s action is. Extreme or aggressive actions mean a high **AP bid**, and cautious actions require less. If you describe an all-out offensive with your sword cutting vicious arcs, you need to bid a lot of **APs**; if you say that you are circling your foe cautiously, a low **bid** is in order. Your GM  will look at the level of risk you are taking, and may suggest that you change your **bid** to better match your actions. If you do not declare a **bid** before rolling the die, your GM will decide how many points are **bid** (using 3 as a default), with riskier actions calling for higher **AP bids**.

#### 5.3.1.3 Losing Advantage Points

The number of advantage points lost by a contestant is a multiplier of their bid depending on the **degree** of the **victory**. Determine the multiplier used as follows:

#### 5.3.1.4 EXTENDED CONTEST EXCHANGE TABLE

|Degree    |AP loss by loser|
|:------:|:------------:|
|Tie|Both lose 1/2 bid, round up|
|0|½ x bid, round up|
|1|1 x bid|
|2|2 x bid|
|3|3 x bid|
|4|4 x bid|
|*n*|*n* x bid|

* If the victor rolled a **big success**, the **APs** lost by the loser are gained by the winner - a transfer.

#### 5.3.1.5  Followers and Advantage Points

**Followers** can act in different ways during a **contest**, **augmenting** you with their **abilities** or allowing you to use one of your **abilities** as if it were your own. Alternatively, a **follower** with a relevant **ability** or **keyword** can simply add their **APs** to the PC’s at the beginning of the **contest**.

Neither you nor the GM makes rolls for **followers**. Instead, their actions are subsumed into yours. The **follower’s** relevant **ability** or **keyword** is used solely as a source of **advantage points**.

You can assign your **followers** to someone else, although you may have to succeed at a contest to persuade a reluctant follower to go along.

#### 5.3.1.6 Advantage Point Knowledge

Once your opponent has won or lost **APs** during the current contest, you can ask the GM what the opposition's **AP** total is. This is where the element of skill comes in. When choosing how many **APs** to stake, you must weigh the effect they want to gain if you succeed versus the risk you face if the action fails.

#### 5.3.1.7 Advantage Point Recalculation

**Advantage points** are only relevant for the length of a particular **contest**. Your PC does not have any until the next **extended contest** begins, when you calculate them all over again.

### 5.3.2 Extended Contest Outcomes

Your GM uses the final **AP** total of the loser to determine the **degree** of the **victory** or **defeat** for the PC.

#### 5.3.2.1 EXTENDED CONTEST OUTCOME TABLE

|Final AP Total  |Degree|
|:--------------:|:-------------:|
|0 to –10 AP     |0              |
|–11 to –20 AP   |1              |
|–21 to –30 AP   |2              |
|–31 or -40 AP   |3              |
|–41 or fewer AP |4              |

Your GM may apply **consequences** and **benefits**  for your PC as they see fit, based on this outcome. 

### 5.3.3 Parting Shot

You once again **bid** **AP** and use an appropriate **ability** against your opponent. Your GM must agree that the size of your **AP** **bid** is sufficient to gain the additional **prize**. The greater the **prize** the more risk that failure will bring them back into the contest, and so the higher the **bid** must be. If you succeed, their **AP** will decrease; their **outcome** may or may not change, but they cannot finish the **round** by taking an action against you.

**Parting shots** are risky; if you fail, an **AP** transfer might bring your opponent back into the **contest**. Your stumble can give them an opening that they can exploit in an effort to snatch **victory** from the jaws of **defeat**.

### 5.3.4 Desperation Stake

You can stake more **advantage points** than you currently have, to a maximum of your starting **AP** total. This allows you to attempt a **desperation stake** even when you are within a single **AP** of **defeat**. Your GM can never stake more **advantage points** than they have.

### 5.3.5 Second Chance

If your PC falls to 0 or fewer **advantage points** in a standard **extended contest**, you are **defeated**. In a **group extended contest**, however, you can try a **second chance** to stay in the **contest**. A **second chance** represents the knack to come back when your opponent turns away to gloat or deal with the other player characters. A character may only attempt one **second chance** in any **contest**.

To attempt a **second chance**, you must be free from attention by the opposition. You must spend a **story point**. You can use a relevant **ability** in a **contest** against the number of **APs** your PC is below 0. Even if you succeed, a **consequence** applies: take a –6 to further actions in this contest.

If you win the **contest**, you rejoin the contest with a positive **AP** total. Your new total is a 1/4 of your original **AP** total at the outset of the **contest**, round up.

Your GM should not use a **second chance** for the **resistance**.

Your GM may decide to impost a **consequence** on you, even if you are later victorious in a contest, or your team wins the prize, that represents the adversity you suffered that brought you initially to defeat.

### 5.3.6 Assists

You can transfer some or all of your **advantage points** to another contestant engaged in a **group extended contest** on your side. With more **advantage points**, they can stay in the **contest** for longer, or make larger **bids** without driving themselves to **defeat**.

State the number of **AP** you are trying to transfer. (The GM may suggest a higher or lower **bid** based on the action you describe.) The number of **APs** you are attempting to transfer is the **resistance** you face in a **contest**. You lost the **APs** whether or not you **succeed** in the contest.

You cannot transfer **advantage points** to yourself.

If a **follower’s AP** are already included in your **AP** total, the **follower** cannot transfer them to you.

### 5.3.7  Joining an In-Progress Contest

Both you and your opponent use your existing **AP** totals.
