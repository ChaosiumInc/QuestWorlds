## 1.3 Who Is This Document For

The primary audience for this document is game-designers who wish to utilize the *QuestWorlds* rules framework to implement their own game.

We also recognize that some people will use this document to learn about the *QuestWorlds* system before purchasing it, and some players in games where the GM has a rule book, may use this as a reference to help understand the rules.

For that latter reason, we address the rules here to a player.

However, this remains a technical document with few examples, advice, or other non-rules text to help you play your game, as such are beyond the scope of this System Reference Document.

It is expected that the designers of games you play based on these rules will include such guidance and context as is relevant to their game's particular genre or setting, presented in a format better suited for learning how to play.
