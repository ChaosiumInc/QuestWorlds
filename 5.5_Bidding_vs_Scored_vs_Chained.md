## 5.5 Wagered Sequences vs Scored Sequences vs Chained Sequences

Your GM chooses ONE form of **sequence** for their game, and sticks to it. The **sequence** rules presentation here is modular: your GMs should choose the one that matches their genre.

**Scored sequences** are fast and simple, and we consider them the default. **Wagered sequences** have the drama of wagering and tend to encourage high-octane stunts, but can take longer to resolve. **Chained sequences** make all **contests** a sequence, where resolve is slowly worn down.

You can think of this as a continuum. At one end are gritty genres where you want to use a **chained sequence** to reflect how punishing conflict is. At the other end are gonzo, larger-than-life genres where you want to use a **wagered sequence** to encourage crazy stunts and outrageous action. In the middle is the **scored sequence** which lets you focus in on tasks to add suspense and drama, without being too grim or too over-the-top.

If in doubt, use a **scored sequence** by default.
