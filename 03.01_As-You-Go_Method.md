## 3.1 As-You-Go Method

1. Choose a **concept**. Your **concept** is a brief phrase, often just a couple of words that tells the GM and other players what you do and how you act. Start with a noun or phrase indicating your **occupation keyword** or area of expertise, and modify it with an adjective suggesting a **distinguishing characteristic**, a personality trait that defines you in broad strokes:

* haughty priestess
* hotshot lawyer
* noble samurai
* remorseful assassin
* sardonic ex-mercenary
* slothful vampire
* naive warrior

2. Now provide your character with a name.
3. If the series uses other **keywords**, such as those for culture or religion, you may gain one for free.
4. When events in the story put you in a situation where you want to overcome a **story obstacle**, or discover the answer to a **story question**, make up an applicable **ability** on the spot. The first time you use an **ability** (including the two you start play with: **distinguishing characteristic** and **occupational keyword**), assign a **rating** to it. This may be a **breakout ability** from a **keyword**. You are restricted to only one **sidekick**.
5. If you want, describe **flaws**.
6. Once you have 12 **abilities** (including the two for character concept), and up to three **flaws** you are done creating your character.
