## 5.1 Sequence 

### 5.1.1 Overview

A **sequence** is a succession of **contests**. It represents a set of tasks required for the PC to overcome an obstacle.

A **sequence** is played out in **rounds**. Each **round** represents an attempt by the PC to wear down the **resistance** by succeeding at a task, that makes up part of the goal. In a **sequence** where a PC thief tries to break into a bank to steal from the safe, individual rounds might represent:

* Obtaining the plans of the bank
* Surveillance to learn the movements of the guards
* Crawling through the air conditioning ducts
* Sliding past the motion sensors and pressure plates
* Cracking the safe itself.

The GM needs to be aware of pacing during this, skipping potential obstacles to try and time the final roll to be as the thief cracks open the safe (or fails triggering more complications).

**Sequences** are longer and more dramatic than **contests**. Your GM uses **sequences** when the drama of the conflict is as important as the **outcome** to the story. A **sequence** generates suspense with a back-and-forth struggle. It is something you and your GM should visualize and describe.

A **sequence** consists of one or more **rounds**, which you resolve as **contests**. However an individual **round** does not decide the **outcome** of the whole **sequence**, only who has momentum at that time.

Different types of **sequence** change how we record who has the upper hand at any one time, based on the **degrees** of the **contest** outcome.

* In a **scored sequence**, the first contestant to have five 'strikes' against them loses. We *tally* **resolution points (RP)**.
* In a **wagered sequence**, the contenders trade momentum and position until one of them crashes. We *tally* **advantage points (AP)**.
* In **chained sequence** the contestants deal harm to each other, and may elect to withdraw if in difficulty. We don't keep a *tally* but apply **consequences**.

Your GM uses this record, either *tallying* or applying **consequences**, to determine when to trigger the end of the **sequence** and the **outcome** for the victor.

#### 5.1.1.1 Procedure

1. Your GM **frames the sequence**.
2. You choose a **tactic**. Your **target number (TN)** is your **rating**, adding any **augments** (see §2.6), **hindrances** (see §2.7), **stretches** and **situational modifiers** (see §2.5), **consequences** and **benefits** (see §2.8.
3. Your GM determines the **resistance** (see §2.4.3). (If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their **TN** as described in step 2.)
4. Carry out one or more **rounds**, repeating as necessary.
    1. Your GM decides which contender has the initiative, the 'aggressor', and describes what they are trying to do to achieve the **prize**. The 'defender' describes how they counter the aggressor's attempt to seize the **prize**. If it is not obvious from the unfolding narrative, your GM should choose your PC as the 'aggressor'.
    2. Resolve the **round** as described for the **sequence** type.
    3. The outcome determines the new *tally* or applies **consequences**. Tied **results** leave the score unchanged.
    4. Determine if an opponent is knocked out of the **contest** from their *tally* or **consequences**, according to the rules for that **contest** type.
    5. The winner has an opportunity to perform a **parting shot** (see §5.1.8).
5. Determine the **outcome** according to the **sequence** type. Award or deny the **prize**, and give **experience points** if appropriate (see §8.1).
6. Determine **benefits** or **consequences**.
7. Describe the **outcome** based on the **story obstacle** or **story question**

### 5.1.2 Group Sequence Overview

**Group sequences** proceed as a series of **sequences** between pairs of PC and opponents, interwoven so that they happen nearly simultaneously.

As in a **sequence** between a single PC and an opponent, each per pair of adversaries contend in a **round**. Usually the PCs make up one team, and their antagonists the other.

A **group sequence** continues until one side has no active participants. If you **defeat** your opponent you can pair with a new opponent. The new opponent might be unengaged, but might also be engaged in an existing pairing. When you pair with an unengaged opponent, you begin a new **sequence**. If your opponent is already engaged in a **sequence**, you participate in the existing **sequence** and  points tally for that type of **sequence**. Alternatively, if you are unopposed, you may choose to help lower the *tally* of an existing participant with an **assist** appropriate to that **sequence** type. Of course, you may be later engaged by an opponent who becomes free yourself.

You may lose some pairings amongst the PCs, but still win if the last participant standing is a PC; otherwise if the last participant belongs to the opposition you lose.

#### 5.1.2.1 Group Sequence Procedure

1. Your GM **frames the sequence**.
2. You choose a **tactic**. Your **target number (TN)** is your **rating**, adding any **augments** (see §2.6), **hindrances** (see §2.7), **stretches** and **situational modifiers** (see §2.5), **consequences** and **benefits** (see §2.8).
3. The GM determines the **resistance** (see §2.4.3). If two PCs contend, your opponent figures their **TN** as described in step 2.
4. The PCs choose their opponents in order of their **TN** where it makes sense. Otherwise your GM will allocate opponents to you dependent on what makes narrative sense.
5. Establish an order of the paired **sequences**. The narrative may indicate who should go first but use your group's **TN**s from highest to lowest if no other option presents itself.
6. For each pairing your GM carries out one **round**. Then they repeat by carrying out more **rounds** in order, as necessary.
    1. Your GM decides which contender has the initiative, the 'aggressor', and describes what they are trying to do to achieve the **prize**. The 'defender' describes how they counter the aggressor's attempt to seize the **prize**. If it is not obvious from the unfolding narrative, your GM should choose your PC as the 'aggressor'.
    2. Resolve the **round** as described for the **sequence** type.
    3. The outcome determines the new *tally* or applies **consequences**. Tied **results** leave the score unchanged.
    4. Determine if an opponent is knocked out of the **contest**, according to the rules for that **contest** type.
    5. The winner has an opportunity to perform a **parting shot** (see §5.1.8).
7. As one of a pair is eliminated from the **group sequence**, their victorious opponents may then move on to engage new targets, either *starting new **contests*** with an unengaged opponent or *joining an existing **contest*** (see §5.1.9). These new contest are added to the end of the existing roster. Alternatively, unengaged contests may **assist** (see §5.1.10) those who are engaged.
8. The group with the last undefeated contestant wins.
9. Award **experience points** if appropriate (see §8.1).
10. Describe the **outcome** based on the **story obstacle** or **story question**.

### 5.1.3 No Nesting

Your GM should never “nest” one **sequence** inside another. If a **sequence** is in progress and you want to perform an action your GM should treat it as an **unrelated action** (see §5.1.8), or disallow it completely during the current **contest**.

### 5.1.4 Switching Abilities

You may describe an action in a **sequence** that is not covered by the **ability** that you started the **sequence** with. There are two possibilities here: either you are trying to provide color to your actions in the **round**, without seeking to gain advantage, or you are seeking to gain advantage over your opponent with a novel **tactic**. In the former case, you can continue to use the **ability** you started the contest with, as you should not be penalized for wanting to enhance the contest with colorful or entertaining descriptions. In the latter case you should switch **abilities**, and your GM must decide if the **resistance** changes because of your new **ability**. Your GM is encouraged to reward **tactics** that exploit weaknesses that have been identified in the story so far with a lower **resistance**. Sometimes your GM may respond with a higher **resistance** because your **tactic** looks less likely to succeed due to conditions already established in the story.

Either way any *tally* does not change. However, it may be possible to avoid **consequences** in a **chained sequence** by switching to am ability that would not be **penalized**.

### 5.1.5 Asymmetrical Round

You may choose to briefly suspend your attempt to best your opponent in a **sequence**, in order to do something else. An instance where you are trying to do something else and your opponent is trying to win the **contest** is called an **asymmetrical round**.

In an **asymmetrical round**, you do not change the *tally* against your opponent,or inflict **consequences** if you win the **round**. Instead, you succeed at whatever else you were doing. Your *tally* is still altered, or you suffer **consequences** if you lose the **round**. Often you will be using an **ability** other than the one you've been waging the **contest** with, one better suited to the task at hand. This becomes additionally dangerous when the **TN** associated with your substitute **ability** is significantly lower than the one used for the rest of the **contest**.

In addition to secondary objectives, as in the above example, you may engage in **asymmetrical round** to **augment** (see §2.6) yourself or others.

### 5.1.6 Disengaging

You can always abandon a **contest**, but, in addition to failing at the **story obstacle**, you may also suffer negative consequences. In a **contest** where your opponent intends to harm you, you will always suffer negative consequences if you withdraw, unless you successfully **disengage**. If your opponent also decides to **disengage** you both do; it is a stand-off and neither side obtains the **prize**.

To make a contested attempt to **disengage**, you make an **asymmetrical round**, using the **ability** relevant to the **contest** you’re trying to wriggle out of.

If you fail, your effort is wasted and the score against you increases, as it would have during a normal **round**. If you succeed, you escape the clutches, literal or metaphorical, of your opponent, without further harm from that **round**. In the case of a **group contest**, you do not count as 'last contestant standing' for the purpose of determining victory. For a contest that uses a *tally*, the GM applies **consequences** against you immediately based upon your *tally* according to the **sequence** type.

### 5.1.7 Unrelated Actions

If you are not currently enmeshed in a **round**, either after a successful disengagement, or after winning a **sequence** as part of a **group sequence**, you may take actions within the scene that do not directly contribute to the **defeat** of the other side. These **unrelated actions** may grant an **augment** to yourself or to a teammate. You may achieve a secondary story objective. This resembles an **asymmetrical round**, except that, as you are not targeted by any opponents, there is no additional risk.

### 5.1.8 Parting Shot

Immediately after you defeat an opponent, you may attempt to worsen the defeat suffered by your opponent by engaging in a **parting shot**. This is an attempt (metaphoric or otherwise) to kick your opponent while he’s down:

* Striking an incapacitated enemy
* Attacking a retreating army
* Attaching one more punitive rider to a legal settlement
* Demanding additional money from a business partner
* Delivering one last humiliating insult

Your GM should not use a **parting shot** for the **resistance**.

The **parting shot** is another **contest** against your **defeated** opponent. The **ability** you use must relate to the consequences the opposition will suffer, but needn’t be the same one you used to win the **contest**. If the loser is a PC they use a suitable **ability** to resist; otherwise the GM rolls a suitable **resistance** value.

The mechanics for a **parting shot** differ for each **sequence** type, reflecting the *tally* or **consequences**.

### 5.1.9 Joining an In-Progress Contest

When you wish to join a **sequence** in progress, you and your GM should discuss whether you accept the current framing. If so, you can participate. You simply select an opponent and start a new **round** with them. The mechanics for joining an in-progress **contest** differ for each **sequence** type, reflecting the *tally* or **consequences**. If you want to achieve something other than the goal established during framing, you may instead perform **unrelated actions**, including **assists** and **augments**.

In some types of conflict, many-against-one may have an advantage. In a melee for example it is more difficult to fight two or more opponents. In other types of contest many-against-one may actually hinder because contenders get in each other's way, such as an attempt to persuade another. In situations in a **sequence** where numerical advantage exists, award a **situational modifier** usually of *zero* **degrees** or *one* degree. This is a **bonus** if the PCs outnumber their opponents and a penalty if they don't. Don't use this rule if you are treating the resistance as a mob (see §2.10)

### 5.1.10 Assists

You may take an **unrelated action** to grant an **assist** to a teammate enmeshed in a **round**. Describe what your character is trying to do to improve the position of the target. For example, your PC might throw them a weapon, jeer at an opponent, or simply shout words of encouragement. **Assists** are subject to the same restrictions as **augments**: they must be both credible and interesting.

The mechanics for a **assist** differ for each **sequence** type, reflecting the *tally* or **consequences**.
