# 7.0 Story Points

*QuestWorlds'* design favors pulp stories and cinematic action. **Story points** mirror the ability of heroes in these genres to "cheat death", or "escape with one bound".

Normally, your GM should ensure that **defeat** takes the story for your PC in an interesting new direction. Unlike some games, where your goal is to win against challenges set by the GM, in a storytelling game your goal is to tell a good story together. Just as in fiction the protagonist can suffer all sorts of reversals, so in a storytelling game, your PC should suffer all sorts of adversities before they triumph (or meet their tragic end). As a result, we recommend against the tendency to 'buy off **defeat**' with **story points** in the middle of the story. Instead, use **story points** when **defeat** would damage the conception of the character that you have been building during the story, or lead to an unsatisfactory climax to the story.

Your GM should push the story in an interesting new direction on **defeat** not send it to a dead end. If there is no interesting branch from **defeat** they should consider an **assured contest** instead.

In other genres, it may feel less appropriate that you can 'cheat certain death.' For those genres you can simply drop **story points** without impacting the game.

In games with a strong player vs. player element, your GM should dispense with **story points** as they become disruptive if used against each other.
