## 2.3 Modifiers

Your GM uses **modifiers** throughout the game. **Modifiers** increment by 5. See Table 2.3.1, Modifiers, for details of the scale.

A positive **modifier** is a **bonus** and a negative **modifier** is a **penalty**.

**Modifiers** represent:

* The **modifier** to apply to the **base resistance** when determining the **resistance's** **TN**; harder challenges have a **bonus** added to the **base resistance**; easier challenges have **penalty** subtracted from the **base resistance** (see $2.4.3).
* A **stretch** based on a lack of credible abilities to overcome an obstacle (see §2.5)
* A **situational modifier** based on the **tactics** chosen by a PC (see §2.5)
* The **outcome** of an **augment** (see §2.6) or **hindrance** (see §2.7)
* The **bonus** of a **benefit** or **penalty** of **consequences** (see §2.8).

The table includes two aspects besides **bonuses** and **penalties**.

We name the **resistances** and equate them to a **bonus** or **penalty** to the **base resistance**. Some people like using the names, other people just use the value of the **modifier**.

For convenience, we show the **target number (TN)** for the default **rating** of 10. (Note that *Assured* indicates that there is no chance of **defeat**).

We equate **degrees** of **victory** and **degrees** of **defeat** to a **bonus** or **penalty** (§2.4.7), in case the GM wants to assign corresponding **benefits** or **consequences**. (Note that as **degrees** represent the difference between results, they begin at *zero*).

### 2.3.1 MODIFIERS TABLE

|Resistance|Degree of Victory|Degree of Defeat|Penalty|Bonus| Base (10) TN|
|:-----:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---:|:--------:|:---:|
|Simple|-|3|-20|-|Assured|
|Easy|-|2|-15|-|Assured|
|Routine|-|1|-10|-|Assured|
|Straightforward|-|0|-5|-|5|
|Base|-|-|-|-|10|
|Challenging|0|-|-|5|15|
|Hard|1|-|-|10|20|
|Punishing|2|-|-|15|5M|
|Exceptional|3|-|-|20|10M|

 A routine obstacle, or less, will usually be an **assured contest** (see §2.4.4.2) and there is no need to roll if the resistance's **TN** is reduced below 0 by **modifiers**.
