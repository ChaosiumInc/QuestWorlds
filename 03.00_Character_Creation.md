# 3.0 Character Creation

The first step in creating your character is to come up with a concept that fits in with the genre of the game that your GM intends to run. With that, you can assign **abilities**, **ratings** for those **abilities**, and if required **flaws**.

In addition, you will want to give your character a name, and provide a physical description. We recommend focusing on three physical things about your PC that others would immediately notice, over anything more detailed.

Your GM should not use this method for creating NPCs. NPCs do not require definition via **abilities** and **keywords**. Instead, your GM simply describes the NPC, and picks an appropriate **resistance** in any contest with them, based on their feeling for what would be **credible** for that NPC. If in doubt the GM just uses the **base resistance** for a mook, with a suitably higher **degree** for a boss. The design intent is to remove the need for the GM to prepare stat blocks, making improvisation of NPCs easier, and shifting focus to the NPCs personality or role in the story instead.
