# 2.0 Mechanics

In a *QuestWorlds* game, stories develop dynamically as you and your GM work together to role-play the dramatic conflict between your group's PCs in pursuit of their goals and the challenges, or threats that your GM presents to stand in your way. Stories advance by two methods: conflict, where your PC is prevented from achieving their goals because there is something that must be overcome, a **story obstacle**, to gain a desired person, thing, or even status: the **prize**; or revelation, where something must be overcome, a **story obstacle**, to learn a secret, uncover the past, or reach understanding: the **prize**.

Over the course of play, your GM will present various **story obstacles** as conflicts to the PCs, resulting in either **victory** or **defeat** for your character, which determines whether or not you gain the **prize** you sought. These conflicts can represent any sort of challenge you might face: fighting, a trial or debate, survival in a harsh environment, out-wooing rival suitors, and so on.

Rather than mechanically addressing the individual tasks that make up these conflicts, *QuestWorlds* usually assesses your overall **victory** or **defeat** in a single **contest** where you and your GM make an opposed roll pitting your characters **ability** vs the **resistance** the **story obstacle** presents to you achieving the **prize**.

Whenever the GM presents a **story obstacle** for you to overcome, you should **frame the contest** by describing what you are trying to accomplish, the **prize**, and which of your **abilities** (see below) you want to use to achieve that **prize**, and how.

Based on that **framing** and other factors, your GM will assess what **resistance** the characters face.

You roll a twenty-sided die (D20) against your PC's **ability**, and your GM rolls a D20 against the **resistance**. Your GM will assess your overall **victory** or **defeat** in the contest based on the **success** or **failure** of both rolls, and narrates the results of your attempt to overcome the **story obstacle** and gain the **prize** accordingly. The direction of the story changes, in either a big or small way, depending on whether you gain the **prize** or not.

We encourage your GM to work with your suggestions when narrating the **victory** or **defeat**, but the final decision rests with them.
