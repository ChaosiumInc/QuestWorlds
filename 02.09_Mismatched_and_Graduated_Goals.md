## 2.9 Mismatched and Graduated Goals

Sometimes, the two sides in a **contest** may have goals that do not directly conflict one another. A huntsman pursues a nurse, who is trying to escape through the forest with two small children. The huntsman wants to capture the nurse. The nurse wants to save the children.

When encountering **mismatched goals**, your GM should determine whether the mismatch is complete, or partial.

In a **complete mismatch**, neither side is at all interested in preventing the otherâ€™s goal. A **complete mismatch** does not end in a **contest**; your GM asks what you are doing, and then describes each participant succeeding at their goals.

In most instances, the **contest** goals are not actually **mismatched**, but **graduated**. You have both a **primary** and a **secondary** goal. In this case, your GM frames the **contest**, identifying which goal is which. It is possible to have **tertiary** goals and so on, but avoid needless sub-division.

On a **victory** you choose one more **graduated** goals than you have **degrees**. On *zero* **degrees** of **victory** you choose one; on *one* **degree** of victory you choose two, and so on. Normally, the GM should give the player the choice of which goals they wish to choose. This goes to the heart of character - what is more important to you?

The nurse has **graduated** goals: escape the huntsman and save the children. On a *zero* **degree** of **victory** she will have to decide between capture and the safety of the children. On *one* **degrees**  of **victory**, she can have both.
