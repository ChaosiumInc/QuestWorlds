## 2.6 Augments

You may sometimes face **contests** where more than one **ability** may be applicable to the conflict at hand. In such cases, you may attempt to use one **ability** to give a supporting bonus to the main ability you are using to frame the **contest**. This is called an **augment**. It results in a **bonus** to your **target number**. For example, if your character has the **abilities** "The Queen's Intelligencer" and "Master of Disguise", you might use the latter to **augment** the former when infiltrating a rival nation's capitol. Similarly, a character with "Knight Errant" and "My Word is my Bond" **abilities** might use one to **augment** the other when in conflict with a **story obstacle** the character has sworn to overcome.

Abilities that represent special items, weapons, armor, or other noteworthy equipment can be a common source of **augments**. However, this grows tired if over-used and you should try and restrict repeated use  of equipment in this way to **contests** where they are particularly interesting or apropos.

**Augments** can also come from other characters' **abilities** if one character uses an **ability** to support another's efforts rather than directly engaging in the **contest**. **Augments** can even come from outside resources like support from a community, see ยง8, or other circumstantial help.

If you have a good idea for an **augment**, propose it to your GM while the **contest** is being framed. When making your proposal, describe how the **augmenting ability** supports the main one in a way that is both *entertaining* and *memorable*. Don't just hunt for mechanical advantage, show your group more about your PC when you **augment**, their attitudes, passions, or lesser known **abilities**. If you are **augmenting** with a **broad ability** like "Fool's Luck", be prepared to describe the unlikely events that tilt the scales in your favor. Your GM will decide whether the **augment** is justified and can refuse boring and uninspired attempts to **augment**, where you are just looking for a bonus to your roll and not adding to the story.

You may only use one of your own **abilities** to **augment** the **ability** you are using in the **contest**, and you may not use an **ability** to **augment** itself. You may not use a **breakout** to augment it's parent **keyword** (see ยง3.3), or another **breakout** from the parent **keyword**. Another player character may also augment you, however, **augments** from other player characters supporting you, only give you *one* **bonus** to add to your **target number**, regardless of the number of supporters you have.

Your GM should bear in mind the credibility of more than one PC helping you. When persuading someone a cacophony of voices may not help, unless you are trying to intimidate; when fighting someone, only so much backup helps you take your opponent down; when flying a starship into the cave on the asteroid, only some crew activities provide credible help. The GM may thus decide to limit the number of augments from other PCs. Consider a group contest (see ยง4.2) instead if many PCs want to act against the **resistance**.

If your GM accepts your **augment** proposal, it will be resolved by the method below. The main **contest** then proceeds as normal, with any bonus from the **augment** added onto the **rating** of the **ability** chosen when **framing the contest**. The **augment** remains in effect for the duration of the **contest**.

### 2.6.1 Augment Procedure

Your GM treats an **augment** as an **assured contest**.

If the use of the **ability** to augment seems unlikely to fail, your GM simply awards you a *zero* **degree** **bonus**, or +5. If your description of how you were using the **augmenting ability** was dramatic or entertaining, your GM may increase this to a *one* **degree** **bonus**, or +10.

As with any **assured contest** GM might still ask you to roll if there is a risk that the **augment** results in a **penalty** to other **abilities** such as resources or **relationships** (see ยง6.0), which become stressed in providing the **augment**, or that more variation in **bonuses** is possible (such as the **augmenting** ability having several **masteries**).

On a **victory** base the **bonus** of the **augment** off the **degree** of the **victory**. So *zero* **degrees** of **victory** yields a *zero* *degree** bonus (+5). On a **defeat** still award a +5 bonus, but apply a penalty related to **degree** of the **defeat** to the **tactic** used to **augment**, as described above.
