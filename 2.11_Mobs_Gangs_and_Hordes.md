## 2.11 Mobs, Gangs, and Hordes

Sometimes you will face large numbers of opponents. Your GM can treat many as one. Your GM divides the number of opponents by the number of contesting PCs. Your GM then treats each of these sections of the crowd as a single **resistance** with one **score**. Their numbers are factored into the **score** your GM assigns to the **resistance**.

When the mob loses an exchange, your GM describes individuals within it as being hurt or falling away. When it wins, describe them overwhelming you, or swelling in numbers.
