## 5.2 Scored Sequence

A **scored sequence** consists of one or more **rounds**; each **round** is a **contest**. We *tally* the position of the contestants in a **scored sequence** via **resolution points**. Once *five* or more resolution points have been *tallied* against a contestant, they lose that **scored sequence**.

In a **scored sequence** there is no distinction between aggressor and defender, each **round** represents attempts by both parties to overcome their opponent and so a is a *single* **contest**. Your GM should determine who has the initiative to describe what they are doing for any **round**, based on their interpretation of the flow of events. If in doubt your GM should defer to you over your opponent to describe what you do in the **round**, and describe the NPC reacting to that.

### 5.2.1 Resolution Points

You score **resolution points** equal to *one* more than the **degree** of the **outcome**. So a *zero* **degree** **outcome** produces *one* **resolution point**, a *one* **degree** **outcome** produces *two* **resolution points** and so on. (You can take the shortcut of adding *one* to the difference in **successes** of the two rolls, if your prefer).

Your **resolution point** score tells you how well you’re doing, relative to your opponent, in the ebb and flow of a fluid, suspenseful conflict. If you’re leading your opponent by 0–4, you’re giving them a thorough pasting. If you’re behind 4–0, you’re on your last legs, while your opponent has had an easy time of it. If you’re tied, you’ve each been getting in some good licks.

* In a fight, scoring *one* **RP** might mean that you hit your opponent with a grazing blow, or knocked him into an awkward position.
* Scoring *two* **RPs** might mean a palpable hit, most likely with bone-crunching sound effects.
* A *three* **RP** hit sends them reeling, and, depending on the realism level of the genre, may be accompanied by a spray of blood.

However, the exact physical harm you’ve dished out to them remains unclear until the **contest's** end. When that happens, the real effects of your various **victories** become suddenly apparent. Perhaps they stagger, merely dazed, up against a wall. Maybe they fall over dead.

* In a debate, *one* **RP** might occasion mild head nodding from spectators, or a frown on your opponent’s face.
* *Two* **RPs** would occasion mild applause from onlookers, or send a flush to your opponent’s face.
* On *three* **RPs**, your opponent might be thrown completely off-track, as audience members wince at the force of your devastating verbal jab.

In interpreting the individual **contest** **rounds** within a **scored sequence**, your GM is guided by two principles:

1. No efect is certain until the entire **scored sequence** is over.
2. When a character scores points, it can reflect any positive change in fortunes, not just the most obvious one.

|Degree    |Value     |
|:------:|:------------:|
|0|1|
|1|2|
|2|3|
|3|4|
|4|5|

#### 5.2.1.2 Resource Point Knowledge

Your GM should make the **resource point** totals for each side public.

#### 5.2.1.3 Followers

You may choose to have your **followers** take part in **scored sequences** in one of three ways: as full contestants, as secondary contestants, or as supporters.

**Contestant**: The **follower** takes part in the **contest** as any other PC would. You roll for your **followers** as you would their main characters. However, your **followers** are removed from the **contest** whenever 3 **resolution points** are scored against them in a given **round**.

**Secondary contestant**: To act as a secondary contestant, your **follower** must have an **ability** relevant to the **contest**. The **follower** sticks by your side, contributing directly to the effort: fighting in a battle, tossing in arguments in a legal dispute, acting as the ship’s navigator, or whatever. Although you describe this, you do not roll for the **follower**. Instead, you may, at any point, shift any number of **resolution points** to a **follower** acting as a secondary contestant. Followers with 3 or more **resource points** lodged against them are removed from the scene. 

**Supporter**: Your **follower** is present in the scene, but does not directly engage your opponents. Instead they may perform **assists** and other **unrelated actions**.

**Followers** acting in any of these three capacities may be removed from the **contest** by otherwise unengaged opponents. To remove a **follower** from a scene, an opponent engages your **follower** in a **contest**. Your GM sets the **resistance**, or if it is another PC's **follower** they determine the relevant **ability** of the **follower** engaging yours. On any failure, your **follower** is taken out of the **contest**.

Your GM determines any long-term implications for the follower being removed from the **contest**. Whilst your GM should not end your character's story without consent, such as via death, they may choose to end the story of a follower in such circumstances, viscerally demonstrating the threat that the PCs face.

### 5.2.2 Scored Sequence Outcomes

Your GM treats the half the difference in **resource points**, rounding up, as the **degree** of your **victory** or **defeat**.

#### 5.2.2.1 SCORED SEQUENCE OUTCOME TABLE

|Difference    |Degree     |
|:------:|:------------:|
|1-2|0|
|3-4|1|
|5-6 |2|
|7-8|3|
|9+|4|

Your GM applies results as described in §2.4.7.2, including assigning **benefits** and **consequences**.

### 5.2.3 Parting Shot

If you succeed in your **parting shot** roll, you score additional **resource points** against your opponent, worsening their defeat.

However, if your opponent succeeds, they take the number of **resolution points** they would, in a standard **round**, score against you, and instead subtracts them from the number of **resolution points** scored against them in the **round** that removed them from the **contest**. If the revised total is now less than 5 **RPs**, they return to the **contest**, and may re-engage you. Your GM describes this as a dramatic turnaround, in which your overreaching has somehow granted them an advantage allowing them to recover from their previous misfortune.

Where it makes sense, unengaged PCs may attempt **parting shots** against opponents taken out of the **contest** by someone else. You may not revive your teammates by using your lamest abilities to make **parting shots** on them; this, by definition, does not pass a **credibility test**.

### 5.2.4 Risky Gambits

During a **scored sequence**, you can attempt to force a conflict to an early resolution by making a **risky gambit**. If you win the **round**, you lodge an additional 1 **resolution point** against your opponent. However, if you lose the **round**, your opponent lodges an additional 2 **resolution points** against you.

If both contestants engage in a **risky gambit**, the winner lodges an additional 2 **resolution points** against the loser.

### 5.2.5 Defensive Responses

In a **scored sequence**, you can make a **defensive response**, lowering the number of **resolution points** lodged against you in a **round**. If you win the **round**, the number of **resolution points** you lodge against your opponent decreases by 1. If you lose, your opponent lodges 2 fewer **resolution points** against you. The total number of **resolution points** assigned by a **round** is never less than 0; there is no such thing as a negative **resolution point**.

### 5.2.6 Assists

The **assist** alters the score against your teammate according to the **outcome** of a **contest**.

Your first **assist** faces a **moderate resistance**. Each subsequent **assist** attempt to the same beneficiary, steps up by one **degree** of increase (+5, +10, +15, +M, +M2). The **resistance** escalation occurs even when another PC steps in to make a subsequent **assist**. This escalation allows the occasional dramatic rescue but makes it difficult for players to prolong losing battles to excruciating length. Your GM should make it seem credible by justifying the increasing **resistances** with descriptions of ever-escalating countermeasures on the part of the opposition.

Your GM may adjust the starting **resistance** up or down by one step to account for campaign credibility or other dramatic factors. If an **assist** as proposed seems too improbable or insufficiently useful, your GM should collaborate with you to propose alternate suggestions which would face **moderate resistance**.

On a victory, you reduce the number of **resolution points** by *one* more than the **degree** of the **victory**. On a defeat, you increase the number of **resolution points** by *one* more than the **degree** of the **resistance's** **victory**. See table §5.2.2.1.

Scores can never be reduced below 0.

### 5.2.7 Joining an In-Progress Contest

If you join in an existing **scored sequence** use the same *tally* of **resolution points**; your fate is now bound to your comrade's fate.
