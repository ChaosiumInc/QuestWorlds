## 2.3 Degrees

Your GM uses a scale known as **degrees** throughout the game.

**Degrees** represent:

* The scale of a **contest** **outcome** (ยง2.4.7)
* An **augment** (see ยง2.6), **stretches** and **situational modifiers** (see ยง2.5)
* **Benefits** and **consequences** (see ยง2.8).
* The modifier to apply to the **base resistance** when determining the **resistance's** **TN**; harder challenges have a higher **degree** of **resistance** (see $2.4.3).

See Table 2.3.1, Degrees, for details of the scale.

So  *zero* **degrees** is +5 or -5, *one* **degree**  is +10 or -10, and so on. It is usually clear but you can use *decreasing* **degree** to refer to a subtraction and *increasing* **degree** to refer to an addition.
