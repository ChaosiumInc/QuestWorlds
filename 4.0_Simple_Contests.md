# 4.0 Simple Contests

**Simple contest**s are the default resolution method for **story obstacles** or **story question** where there is a dramatic branch from uncertainty. If the branch does not lead to new story, just use an **assured contest**.

A **simple contest** is conflict resolution, we don't resolve the individual tasks that form part of the **story obstacle** or **story question** instead we resolve the whole **story obstacle** or **story question** in one roll. When you pick your **tactic** it may encompass your approach to the whole, or be a spotlight moment, where the part stands for the whole. In the latter case your chosen **tactic** is the focus of the key moment. It all comes down to this moment, where you win the **prize** or your plans go awry. Your GM will narrate your passage through the other obstacles once the outcome is known, but the focus of win and lose always hinges on this moment.

Using **simple contest** as the default speeds up play, and keeps the story hitting major events, reinforcing the sense of adventure.
