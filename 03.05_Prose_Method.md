## 3.5 Prose Method

### 3.5.1 Alternative Character Creation

This is the an alternative character creation method in which you write a piece of prose and then pull **abilities** from that. Its intent is to emulate a character description in fiction, and indeed PCs can be built by copying text from a story and then identifying **keywords**. It is the least 'fair' of the character creation options.

Your GM should choose either "As You Go" or "Prose Method" not both. Choose the "Prose Method" only if your players are comfortable writing a short biography for their character.

### 3.5.2 The Prose Method

You write a paragraph of text like you would see in a story outline, describing the most essential elements of your character. Include **keywords**, personality traits, important possessions, relationships, and anything else that suggests what you can do and why. The paragraph should be about 100 words long.

Compose the description in complete, grammatical sentences. No lists of **abilities**; no sentence fragments. Your GM may choose to allow sentences like the previous one for emphasis or rhythmic effect, but not simply to squeeze in more cool things you can do.

Once your narrative is finished, convert the description into a set of **abilities** and **flaws**. Mark any **keywords** with double underlines. Mark any other word or phrase that could be an **ability** or **flaw** with a single underline. Then write these **keywords**, **abilities** or **flaws** on your character sheet. Remember that some **abilities** and **flaws** may be a **breakout** from a **keyword**.

There is no limit to the number of **abilities** you can gain from a single sentence, as long as the sentence is not just a list of **abilities**. If your GM decides a sentence is just a list, they may allow the first two **abilities**, or they may tell the player to rewrite the sentence. Note, however, that you cannot specify more than one **sidekick** in your prose description.
