## 2.5 Bonuses and Penalties from Tactics

Your GM can give you **bonuses** and **penalties** to alter your **target number** due to unusual circumstances you helped to create, or have some control over. Commonly, your GM gives you a **bonus** or **penalty** because the **tactic** that you chose seems likely to give you an advantage, or a penalty. This will be a **stretch** or a **situational modifier**. If an unusual situation applies to a **resistance**, the GM should choose a **resistance** that reflects that.

### 2.5.1 Stretches

When you propose an action using an **ability** that seems completely inappropriate, your GM rules it impossible. If you went ahead and tried it anyway, you’d automatically fail—but you won’t, because that would be silly.

In some cases, though, your proposed match-up of action and **ability** is only somewhat implausible. A successful attempt with it wouldn’t completely break the illusion of fictional reality—just stretch it a bit.

Using a somewhat implausible **ability** is known as a **stretch**. If your GM deems an attempt to be a **stretch**, the PC suffers a -5 or –10 **penalty** to their **target number**, depending on how incredible the **stretch** seems to the GM and other players. Your GM should **penalize** players who try to create a 'do anything' **ability** that they then **stretch** to gain from raising fewer **abilities** in advancement to ensure balance with other PCs.

The definition of **stretch** is elastic, depending on genre.

Your GM should not impose **stretch penalties** on action descriptions that add flavor and variety to a scene, but do not fundamentally change what you can do with your **ability**. These make the scene more fun but don’t really gain any advantage.

### 2.5.2 Situational Modifiers

Your GM may also impose **situational modifiers** when, given the description of the current situation, believability demands that you should face a notable **bonus** or **penalty**. Your GM should choose *one* or *two* **degrees** of +10, +5, –5, or –10. **Bonuses** and **penalties** of less than 5 don’t exert enough effect to be worth the bother. Those higher than 10 give the **situational modifier** a disproportionate role in determining **outcomes**.

During a **sequence** (see §5.0), they should typically last for a single **round**, and reflect clever or foolish choices.
