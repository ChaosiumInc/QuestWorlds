## 3.2 Keywords

We recommend that you build your PC around one or more **keywords** (see §2.1.1).

**Keywords** are best suited for use as the PC’s occupation, heritage, beliefs, or memberships of a community.

In certain genres, your GM may require that your PC has multiple **keywords**: for example, one for **occupation**, another for species or culture, and perhaps a third for religious affiliation.

### 3.2.2 Doubling Up

In some settings, an **ability** may be listed in more than one of a PC’s **keywords**. You should choose only one to list it under.

If your **distinguishing characteristic** is an **ability** that fits under a **keyword** then you can make it a breakout there.
