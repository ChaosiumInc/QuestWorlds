## 10.2 Version Changes

### Version 3.0

These are the major changes in this version of the rules

* Moved to measuring a result by a number of successes and comparing them, simplifying masteries.
* Split hero points into story points (bumps) and experience points (character improvement). Flaws generate experience points as do failures.
* Removed the Degree of Victory. Now just calculate outcome degrees from success counts.
* Changed degree of success and failure, to degree of victory and defeat, as success and failure are for individual rolls, victory and defeat once compared.
* Made degrees codify the +5, +10, +15, ... progression used throughout, for example degrees of resistance.
* For outcomes clarified that contest results are only reciprocal between PCs. When the contest is against a resistance set by the GM, the results indicate whether the PC gains the prize, and the GM narrates the result for the resistance based on this.
* Changed outcomes to emphasize degrees. This change is designed to dissuade GMs from misunderstanding that the prize is obtained on a marginal victory, one of the most common result types, and instead encourage GMs to allow PCs to fail forward on a zero degree victory by introducing downstream complications or consequences.
* Provided clarity that consequences of defeat and benefit of victory are optional and the GM should focus on using the prize to narrate the outcome of a contest, only applying mechanical benefits or penalties if they make sense.
* Specific Ability Bonuses are dropped. They were hard for the GM to adjudicate and the same intent is better served by using a stretch on a broad ability when contesting against a PC with a more specific ability.
* Made it clear that only a PC should use a parting shot, not the resistance.
* Sequences replace all 'long' contest types. Between version 1 and version 2 extended contests switched to scored contests, this approach restores both variants, but changes the name to a sequence generically, factoring out commonality, and to scored and wagered respectively. Goal is to show contest as the atomic unit within a sequence.
* Dropped edges and handicaps - we use a resistance not stats, so makes no sense to have edges and handicaps
* Added Mythic Russia's Plot Edits
* Simplified how multiple opponents are handled.
* Clarified contest outcomes for sequences, and how to determine the overall winner in a sequence.
* Do not allow transfers in a wagered sequence where the abilities differ by 6 or more. Consistent with benefits of victory and prevents 'loading up on mooks' as a strategy.
