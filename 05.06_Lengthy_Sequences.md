## 5.7 Lengthy Sequences

There’s no particular time scale associated with **sequences**. But some **sequences** may by their very nature be a drama that can’t be resolved at one point in the narrative. Examples include political campaigns, construction projects, or seductions. These can be resolved by **sequences** where each **round** is conducted at an appropriate moment, rather than in close succession. 

Your GM will need to keep track of the *tally*. They need to keep the running total for **advantage points** or **resolution points**, and perhaps track running totals for **consequences** or **benefits** in a **chained sequence** if they only impact future **rounds** in the **sequence**. They will also have to track the **resistance**, though this might change as the context changes (a civil war started by the players could impede their castle-building plans). 

The challenges of each round will vary, and you may use a different **ability** or **augment** in the each round.
