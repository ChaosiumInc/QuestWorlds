## 2.4 Contest Procedure

You choose an **ability** relevant to the conflict at hand, describe exactly what you are trying to accomplish, and how. Your GM may modify these suggested actions to better fit the fictional circumstances, and describe the actions of the NPCs or forces on the other side of the conflict.

### 2.4.1 Framing the Contest

#### 2.4.1.1 Contest Framing Overview

When a conflict arises during the game, you and your GM start by clearly agreeing on:

* What goal you are trying to achieve. We call this the **prize**.
* What the **story obstacle** is you are trying to overcome or **story question** you are trying to answer.
* What **tactic** you are using to and overcome it.

This process is called **framing the contest**.

#### 2.4.1.2 Conflict: Goals vs Obstacles

**Contests** in *QuestWorlds* don’t simply tell you how well you performed at a particular task: they tell you whether or not you overcame a **story obstacle**, or learned the answer to a **story question** which moves the story in a new direction. Unlike some other roleplaying games, a **contest** in *QuestWorlds* does not resolve a task, it resolves the whole **story obstacle** or provides a complete answer to the **story question**.

If you need secret records which are stored in a vault within a government compound, your goal is to get the information to answer a **story question**. Answering that **story question** may involve many possible tasks, evading guards, lock-picking, forging credentials, etc. - but the **contest** doesn't address those individually. The **contest** is framed around the entire conflict against the **story question** as a whole.

In a fight, your **story obstacle** may be the opponents themselves, who you are fighting to capture or kill. Just as often you are seeking another goal and you might just as easily attain it by incapacitating or evading your foes. In this case, beating the enemy is a task, not the **story obstacle**. For example, if an **ally** has been accused of treason by the King, your goal could be to prove the **ally's** innocence. The power of the King threatening your **ally** is a **story obstacle** to be overcome, and a trial by combat could be a **contest** to resolve the conflict with an **ability** like "Knight Errant."

In a court trial, your goal is likely a particular verdict, while the **story obstacle** might be the opposing lawyer, an unjust law, or even the justice system itself.  In this case, jury selection, a closing argument, revelatory evidence, or legal procedural challenges are tasks, not the entire **story obstacle**. The overall conflict encompasses all those things.

A conflict to overcome a **story obstacle** or **story question** moves the story forward when it is resolved. If it is merely a step toward resolving a **story obstacle** it is a task and not a conflict. While those component tasks may be interesting parts of narrating **tactics** and **results**, your GM should be sure to look for the **story obstacle** or **story question** in conflict when framing a **contest**.

If there is no **story obstacle**  or **story question** to your actions, your GM should not call for a **contest** but simply let you narrate what you do, provided that seems credible.

For example, you are traveling from one star system to another. In the next star system you hope to confront the aged rebel who holds long-forgotten secrets that could bring freedom to the galaxy. Your GM feels there is no useful **story obstacle** for you to **contest** against, and so lets you describe heading down to the spaceport to secure a ship, meeting the captain and crew of your vessel, and traveling to the next world. Your GM encourages you to summarize what happens quickly so you can get to the meeting with the old rebel. Your GM knows there **story question** to convince the old rebel to part with their secrets.

#### 2.4.1.3 No Repeat Attempts

A **contest** represents all of your attempts to overcome a **story obstacle** or reveal the answer to the **story question**. If you lose it means that no matter how many times you tried to solve the problem, you finally had to give up. You can try again only if you use a new **tactic** to overcome the **story obstacle** or answer the **story question**.

#### 2.4.1.4 Tactics

You either choose an **ability** that represents any 'key moment' in overcoming that **story obstacle** or answering that **story question**, or a broad **ability** that lets you overcome the whole **story obstacle** or solve the mystery of the **story question**. We call this choosing a **tactic**.

Your **tactic** might describe your using an **ability** that helps you overcome a task within the **story obstacle** or **story question**:  sneaking past the guards, picking the locks, choosing the right jury or skewering your opponent with your foil. Or, your **tactics** might describe using a broad ability like "Ninja", "Lawyer", or "Fencer" to overcome all those challenges that might form part of the **story obstacle** or **story question**.

Either way, if you succeed at that roll, you overcome the whole **story obstacle** or learn the answer to the **story question**. Or by failing at that roll, you fail to overcome the **story obstacle** or reveal the answer to the **story question**, not just fail at one task.

When deciding on your **tactic**, focus on how your unique abilities would help you overcome the **story obstacle** or reveal the answer to the **story question**. This as the "key moment" where we focus on your PC. Use this moment to reveal your PC's strengths to the group.

Your GM will determine if your **tactic** passes a **credibility test**. If you try to jump a 100 meters gap or run faster than a speeding car, your action is not credible and your GM will ask you to choose a different **tactic**.

Credibility depends on the genre, as what is not credible in a gritty police procedural might be in pulp where you might be able to leap from a bridge onto a speeding train. If in dispute, your GM should discuss with the group whether they consider your **tactic** credible for the genre.

**Extraordinary abilities** in some genres give you the capability to do the incredible. For example in a superhero genre you might fly or be invulnerable to bullets, in a fantasy genre hurl magical lightning bolts. A genre pack for the game should help define what incredible **tactics** are allowed for that game as part of an *Extraordinary Powers Framework*.

The GM can narrate the remaining tasks that make sense of the story depending on your **success** with that roll, or have them occur 'off-stage' for speed. Think of the way TV or Cinema often cuts to the key moment of drama in a break-in, over showing us the whole heist from beginning to end.

### 2.4.2 Target Number, Bonuses and Penalties

Your **ability's** **rating** may be modified by a number of factors. Your **target number**—the number you must roll under or equal to on a D20 to succeed—is your **rating** with any applicable modifiers. Positive modifiers are called **bonuses**; negative modifiers are called **penalties**.

**Bonuses**, may raise your **target number** high enough to gain a **mastery**. **Penalties**, may lower an **target number** to the point where it loses one or more **masteries**.

The following rules sections describe sources of **bonuses** and **penalties**: **augments** (see §2.6), **hindrances** (see §2.7), **stretches** and **situational modifiers** (see §2.5), **consequences** and **benefits** (see §2.8).

These apply to PC's **target numbers** only, and never to the **resistance** (see §2.4.3). The GM sets the **resistance** according to the needs of the story, and thus it is not further modified.

If **penalties** reduce your **target number** to 0 or less, any attempt to use it automatically **results** in  **failure**. You must find another way to achieve your aim.

### 2.4.3 Resistance

Your GM chooses a **resistance** to represent the difficulty of the **story obstacle** or **story question**. By default, the **base resistance** starts at 10.

When setting **resistance**s it is important to understand that whilst traditional roleplaying games simulate an imaginary reality, *QuestWorlds* emulates the techniques of fictional storytelling.

Understanding this distinction will help you to play the game in a natural, seamless manner.

For example, let’s say that your GM is playing a game inspired by fast-paced, non-fantastic, martial arts movies in a contemporary setting. You are running along a bridge, pacing a hovercraft, piloted by the main bad guy. You want your character, Joey Chun, to jump onto the hovercraft and punch the villain’s lights out.

Your GM starts with the proposed action’s position in the storyline. They consider a range of narrative factors, from how entertaining it would be for you to have a  succeed, how much failure would slow the pacing of the current sequence, and how long it has been since you last scored a thrilling victory. If, after this, they need further reference points, your GM can draw inspiration more from martial arts movies than the physics of real-life jumps from bridges onto moving hovercraft. Having decided how difficult the task ought to be dramatically,your GM will then supply the physical details as color, to justify their choice and create suspension of disbelief, the illusion of authenticity that makes us accept fictional incidents as credible on their own terms. If they want Joey to have a high chance of success, your GM describes the distance between bridge and vehicle as impressive (so it feels exciting if you make it) but not insurmountable (so it seems believable if you make it).

In *QuestWorlds* your GM will pick a **resistance** based on dramatic needs and then justify it by adding details into the story.

Your GM determines the **resistance** from a **base resistance**. If your GM feels that it is hard then they will modify the **resistance** by a **degree** depending on their view of how difficult the obstacle is for you. Increasing **degrees** make it harder to succeed, and decreasing **degrees** easier.
  
The **degree** never reduces the **resistance** value below 0. If the GM assesses a **degree** for the resistance that would take the **target number** below 0, it becomes an **assured contest**.

All **contests** use the **base resistance** + *optional* **degrees**, except for **contests** to determine **augments**. **Augmenting** always faces the **base resistance**.

### 2.4.4 Resolution Methods

The basic resolution methods are as follows:

#### 2.4.4.1 Contest

The **contest** is *QuestWorlds*' primary resolution mechanic for overcoming **story obstacles**, and is used the most often where the outcome is uncertain. It also provides the foundation for other types of uncertain **contest**, including several **long** ones. As such, it receives both an overview of key concepts here as well as a more detailed treatment in §4.

A **contest** can be summarized as follows:

1. You and your GM agree upon the terms of the **contest**.
2. Your **target number (TN)** is your **rating**, adding any **augments** (see §2.6), **hindrances** (see §2.7), **stretches** and **situational modifiers** (see §2.5), **consequences** and **benefits** (see §2.8).
3. You roll a D20 vs your relevant **target number**, while your GM rolls a D20 vs the **resistance**.
4. Your GM compares the difference **successes** between the two rolls to assesses the **outcome** (see §2.4.6).
5. Your GM then narrates the **outcome** of the conflict as appropriate and assesses any **benefits** or **consequences** that arose (see §2.8).

If you enter into conflict with another player rather than a **story obstacle** or **story question** presented by your GM, you both roll your relevant abilities for the **contest** instead of against a GM-set **resistance**, and your GM interprets the **results**, as described above.

#### 2.4.4.2 Assured Contest

Some **obstacles** don't require a roll to overcome. You’ll just do it and keep going, much as you get dressed in the morning or drive your car to work. We call these kinds of contests **assured** contests because your **victory** is assured. Your GM may want to describe your **victory** as a sweat inducing challenge for you, even though there is no risk of **defeat**, to highlight the heroic struggle of your PC to beat the obstacle, nonetheless.

As your character advances, the challenges that qualify for **assured contests** will become more complex. If you face a driving challenge, the bar for assured will be much lower for a champion Formula 1 racer than a typical commuter.

**Assured contests** are the GM’s primary tool to establish your character’s competence. This makes them one of the most powerful and frequently used tools in a GM’s tool chest. Remember, your GM doesn’t have to, and usually shouldn’t advise you you’re involved in an **assured contest**, so it's best to treat all **contests** as if your skin is on the line.

Your GM may also use an **assured contest** when there is no interesting story branch from **defeat**. If failing to open the derelict spaceship's hatch means that the story of your exploration of the ancient space hulk would end abruptly, your GM may choose to make it an **assured contest**. **Assured contests** may be used to find clues when your GM is running a mystery and correct application of one of your **abilities** should reveal the information and allow the story to continue, over becoming mired due to a missed roll and missing clue.

Sometimes your GM will decide potential complications could arise in overcoming an **story obstacle** or answering a **story question**. Or they may want to give you a boost if you do particularly well. If so, they will call for you to make a die roll even though your **victory** is not in question. Your GM will use your die roll **outcome** (see §2.4.7) to decide if any unforeseen **consequences** or **benefits** arose from your actions, but still gives you a **victory**.

An **assured contest** can be summarized as follows:

1. You and your GM agree upon the terms of the **contest**.
2. The GM may decide that you simply gain the **victory** and there are no **consequences** or **benefits** beyond that.
3. If not the GM conducts a contest.
4. Your **target number (TN)** is your **rating**, adding any **augments** (see §2.6), **hindrances** (see §2.7), **stretches** and **situational modifiers** (see §2.5), **consequences** and **benefits** (see §2.8).
5. You roll a D20 vs your relevant **target number**, while your GM rolls a D20 vs the **resistance**.
6. Your GM compares the difference **successes** between the two rolls to assesses the **outcome** (see §2.4.7).
7. Your GM then narrates how you obtained your **victory** and any **benefits** or **consequences** that arose.

### 2.4.5 Die Rolls

To determine how well you use an **ability**, roll a 20-sided die (D20). At the same time, your GM rolls for the **resistance**.

Compare your rolled number with your **target number (TN)** to determine the **result**. Remember that **bonuses** and **penalties** may mean your **TN** gains or loses a **mastery**.

* **Big Success**: If the die roll is equal to the **TN**, you succeed brilliantly, and gain *two* **successes**. This is the best **result** possible.
* **Success**: If the die roll is less than the **TN**, you succeed, but there is nothing remarkable about the success. You gain *one* **success**.
* **Failure**: If the die roll is greater than the **TN**, you fail. Things do not happen as hoped. You gain *zero* **successes**

### 2.4.6 Additional Successes

You can gain additional **successes** beyond the dice roll. An additional **success** comes from one of two sources.

* Each **mastery** you have gives you an additional **success**.
* You can spend a **story point** (see §7.0) to receive an additional **success**.

If you have multiple **masteries** you receive additional successes for **each** of them.

The additional **successes** add to any **success** obtained on the die roll.

If a PC with a **mastery** rolls a **big success** they receive an **additional success** for the **mastery** and two **successes** for the **big success**, making a total of *three* **successes**.

### 2.4.7 Outcome

Your **successes** and the **resistance's** successes are compared to determine your overall **outcome** which will be either **victory** or **defeat** for the **contest** as a whole.

For a contest:

* If you have a *more* **successes** than the GM, then you have a **victory** and you gain the **prize**.
* If you have a *fewer* **successes** than the GM, then you are **defeated** and do not gain the **prize**.
* If you both have the *same* number **successes**, including if you both have *zero* **successes**, then the higher roll has a **victory** and gains the **prize**. If your rolls tie, then there is a standoff with neither side able to take control of the **prize**.

For an assured contest:

* You have a **victory** and you gain the **prize** set out when the **contest** was framed.

#### 2.4.7.1 Degrees of Victory and Defeat

Your **degree** is the difference between your **successes** and the **resistance's** **successes**. It is a **degree** of **victory** if you win and a **degree** of **defeat** if you lose.

If you have *two* **successes** and the resistance has *zero* **successes** you have *two* **degrees** of **victory**. If you have *zero* **successes** and the **resistance** has *one* **success** you have *one* **degree** of defeat. If you have *one* **success** and the **resistance** has *one* **success** you have *zero* **degrees** and **victory** belongs to the high roll.

A lot of the time your GM won't need to figure out the **degrees** as knowing you won or lost is enough.

#### 2.4.7.2 Narrating Outcomes

Your GM narrates the contest **outcome**. Their narration should take into account the **prize** and the **tactics** used by each side. Your GM may invite you to contribute more detail on your actions as part of that narration, if they wish. But the GM is the final arbiter of how the story progresses as a result of the rolls - provided they respect the **outcome** in which you win or lose the **prize**.

 Your GM should bear in mind your **result** when describing the outcome. The **degree** is a guide for the GM when narrating the outcome as to how convincing a victory was. If you have *zero* **degrees**, the GM should describe your actions as successful, but the **resistance** as competent. If you have *two* **degrees**, your GM should describe a convincing **victory** in which your adversary is clearly outclassed.

The GM is narrating a car chase through the busy streets of New Los Angeles. The PCs are trying to catch the demon-worshipper Ath'Zul who has stolen The Eye of Lorus from a museum. Some examples of how the GM might interpret **outcomes** as follows:
 
* PC one **success** vs. Ath'Zul one **success**, the PC has the higher roll, *zero* **successes** difference, and *zero* **degrees** of victory: Ath'Zul tries to shake the PCs, his hover bike, weaving in and out of traffic, but the PCs are always on his tail, and catch him at the lights on Bradbury Junction.
* PC one **success** vs. Ath'Zul zero **successes**, the PC has *one* success difference and *one* **degree** of **victory**: Ath'Zul tries to shake the PCs, his hover bike, weaving in and out of traffic, but the PCs force him off the road, where his bike loses repulsor lift and halts.
* PC two **successes** vs. Ath'Zul zero **successes**, the PC has *two* successes difference *two* **degrees** of **victory** : Ath'Zul tries to shake the PCs, his hover bike, weaving in and out of traffic, but he crashes into a parked car, spilling Ath'Zul and the stolen artefact over the road.

Your GM should avoid robbing your PC of competence by describing your **defeat** as due to your incompetence when you may have rolled a **success**.

The **degrees** may be more directly used when considering **consequences** and **benefits** (see §2.8)

#### 2.4.7.3 Confusing Ties

Your GM will describe most tied **outcomes** as inconclusive standoffs, in which neither of you gets what you wanted.

In some situations, ties become difficult to visualize. Chief among these are **contest**s with binary **outcomes**, where only two possible results are conceivable.

Your GM can either change the situation on such a tie, introducing a new element that likely renders the original **prize** irrelevant to both participants, or they can resolve the ties in your favor as a **victory**.

#### 2.4.7.4 Victory at a Price

Your GM may treat *zero* **degrees** of **victory** as 'victory at a price' and *zero* **degree** of **defeat** as 'defeat with a gift'. The 'price' is a cost that the victor pays for obtaining the prize, a 'gift' is something positive the loser takes away. Your GM may ignore this option, and simply award you or deny you the **prize**, if they cannot think of a dramatically interesting reason to provide a 'price' or 'gift'. Your GM may use **consequences** to represent a 'price' and **benefits** to represent a 'gift', see §2.8. Your GM may also decide that the 'price' or 'gift' is represented by the narration.

* PC one **success** vs. Ath'Zul one **success**, the PC has the higher roll, *zero* **successes** difference, and *zero* **degree** of **victory**: Ath'Zul tries to shake the PCs, his hover bike, weaving in and out of traffic, but the PCs are always on his tail, and catch him at the lights on Bradbury Junction, *by ramming their pursuit car into Ath'Zul's bike, damaging both vehicles*. The GM may award a **consequence** (see §2.8) to represent the damage to the PC's car, injuries from the crash, or displeasure from their commander for damaging more police property.

#### 2.4.7.5 One Outcome, For the PC

There is one **outcome** to a **contest** and it always applies to the PC. Your GM does not consider a separate outcome for the **resistance**, instead they narrate the **outcome** based on whether the your PC obtains the **prize** and describe how the story branches for the **resistance** based on their interpretation of that. Rules on **benefits** and **consequences** in §2.8 and narration considerations such as 'victory at a price', only apply to your PC, not to the resistance.

The only exception to this is a PC vs. PC contest, where each sides **outcome** needs to be determined.
