## 8.3 Milestone Improvements

Your GM may decide that they do not want to track **experience points** earned during a game. In this case they may switch to **milestone improvement**.

Under **milestone improvements** the GM simply declares that your PCs have reached a point in the story where we should see them improve their **abilities** and award you an **advance** (see ยง8.2).

Your GM should not use both **experience points** and **milestone improvements** but choose one. If in doubt, choose **experience points** as the default. **Milestone improvements** do not naturally balance against the **resistance** and the GM may need to use **resistance progression** to continue to up the threat level against your PCs (see ยง2.8).
