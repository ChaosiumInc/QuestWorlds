## 2.1 Abilities

Characters in *QuestWorlds* are defined by the **abilities** they use to face the challenges that arise in the course of their story. Rather than having a standard list of attributes, skills, powers, etc. for all characters, anything that you can apply overcome a **story obstacle** or answer a **story question** could be one of your **abilities**. While your GM may provide some example **abilities** to choose from that connect your PC to a particular story or game world (whether created by your GM or by the designer of a particular game), you get to make up and describe most or all of your **abilities**.

Some **abilities** might be broad descriptions of your background or expertise, like "Dwarf of the Chalk Hills" or "Private Detective" - implying a variety of related capabilities. Others might represent specific capabilities or assets such as "Lore of the Ancients," "Captain of the Fencing Team," or "The Jade Eye Medallion."

Ultimately, **abilities** are just names for the interesting things your character can do.

### 2.1.1 Keywords

A **keyword** is a broad **ability** that often represents an occupation, a heritage, a belief system or participation in a community. The simplest way to use a **keyword** is as an **ability** that represents the competencies of an occupation, knowledge and attitudes passed down via a heritage, values of a belief system, or relationships from a community. In the kinds of fiction that *QuestWorlds* emulates it is usually enough to know that someone has a particular occupation or heritage to know what they can do.

A **keyword** reduces the number of **abilities** your PC needs to track, and is a simplification to help you easily create archetypical characters for a genre without excessive bookkeeping.

Your GM's genre pack should have a text description, which hints at the credible uses of a **keyword**.

Any broad concept you come up with for an **ability**, may be better presented as a **keyword**.

#### 2.1.1.1 Breakouts

A **breakout** allows you to track a competency within the **keyword** individually, as an **ability**.

If your character is renowned for a skill that credibly falls under one of your **keywords**, you create a **breakout ability** under the **keyword** at a **bonus** from the **rating** of the **keyword**. You write these specialized **breakout abilities** under the **keyword**, along with how much they've improved from the **keyword**:

Detective 15

* Deduction +5
* Hard Drinking +5

In this example, whilst the **rating** for most **contests** in which Detective was an appropriate **tactic** would be 15, for contests involving Deduction it would be 20.

The list of **breakout abilities** in a **keyword** is open-ended, but your GM's genre pack description of the keyword will provide inspiration, and might include a list of suggested **abilities** for unfamiliar settings, where it is less clear what a **keyword** encompasses.

Even if there is a suggested list, the potential uses of the **keyword** are always open-ended, provided they are credible. As the genre pack description tends to be assumed in the **keyword**, which is already treated as an **ability**, it can be more interesting to have them *differentiate* your PC from the archetype.

### 2.1.2 Flaws

Your character may have one or more **flaws**. Unlike an **ability**, you do not use a **flaw** to accomplish something; instead the GM uses your **flaw** to hinder you from accomplishing something, or invokes your **flaw** to force you to act a certain way.

**Flaws** may be psychological weaknesses such as "Alcoholic" or "Heroin Addict", or physical weaknesses such as "One-Eye," "Wheelchair-Bound" or "Asthmatic." A **flaw** might also be a moral philosophy such as "Code Against Killing," "Pacifist," or "Radical Candor" that limit your behavior in some way. A **flaw** also might be a relationship such as a "Frail Aunt," "Single Dad," or "Blackmailed".

Many **flaws** describe attributes that can be viewed positively. By making it a **flaw** and not an **ability** you are inviting your GM to use it to make your life more difficult, not easier.

You should not use your **flaw** to accomplish something; if you feel that is likely, use an **ability** and flag to your GM when you want them to treat it as a **flaw** at an appropriate moment.

Ultimately, in *QuestWorlds* a **flaw** is simply something that you invite the GM to use to hinder or prevent your character doing something. In return for the GM exercising the **flaw** you gain **experience points** (see §8.1).

In play your PC may work to overcome a **flaw** and you may reach the point that you agree with your GM that story events mean that it is no longer relevant. You can then drop that **flaw** from your character sheet when you receive an advance (see §8.2).

You can add a new **flaw** if play suggests one might emerge, with discussion with the GM, when you receive an **advance** (see §8.2).

### 2.1.3 Ratings and Masteries

*QuestWorlds* **abilities** are scored on a **rating** of 1–20, representing the **target number (TN)** you need to roll or less to succeed in a **contest** (see §2.4 for more details).

 Once your **ability** passes 20, you would always be able to roll under it on a D20. So to allow abilities to scale over 20 we use **tiers** of capability we refer to as a **masteries**.  
 
 We denote a **rating** with a **mastery** as **TN** + M, for example 7M represents a **TN** of 7 and one **mastery**. We represent abilities above 20M as **TN** + M2, for example 4M2 represents a **TN** of 4 and two **masteries**.

 The progression of **ability** **ratings** is: 1-20, 1M-20M, 1M2-20M2, 1M3-20M3 and so on.

Specific *QuestWorlds* games or genre packs may use other symbols relevant to their setting or genre to denote **mastery** instead of M. If so, this should be clearly noted by their designers.

For how **masteries** work in play, see §2.4.6.

### 2.1.4 No Relevant **Ability**

You may sometimes be faced with a **story obstacle**  or **story question** for which you have no relevant **ability** whatsoever. In such cases, you may still enter into conflict with the **story obstacle** using a **stretch** or a **rating** of 5 for your **contest** roll.

### 2.1.5 Understanding Ratings

*QuestWorlds* treats **ratings** as a measure of how effective you are at solving problems with the **ability**, and does not limit what you can do with that **ability**, provided your actions are credible in genre.
