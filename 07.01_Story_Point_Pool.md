## 7.1 Story Point Pool

At the beginning of play, your GM will create a **story point pool** for your group. The **story point pool** has one **story point** per PC. 

During play you can **burn** one or more points from this **pool**, after which it is lost. You can decide to spend **story points** at any time. You do not need agreement from the other players to do so.

### 7.1.1 Refreshing Story Points

Because you burn a **story point** to use it, your **story point pool** may become exhausted. The GM has three choices for **refreshing** your **story point pool:**

* The **story point pool refreshes** at the beginning of every session of play.
* The **story point pool refreshes** whenever your PCs engage in genre-appropriate downtime. Usually the GM plays this out as a montage, asking your character to describe genre appropriate activities in this time period. For example: in a police procedural series, the PCs might gather at a cop bar to drink and talk about their personal problems; in a series about high-school paranormal investigators they might gather in the school library to chill with their mentor, the librarian, and talk about teenage problems.
* The **story point pool refreshes** whenever the GM deems it necessary, based on their desire to allow you to edit the upcoming story.

Ultimately your GM is always the arbiter of  when and how the **story point pool refreshes**. On a refresh your **story points** pool resets to one **story point** per PC.

* At the beginning of a session you have 1 **story points** per PC in the pool.
