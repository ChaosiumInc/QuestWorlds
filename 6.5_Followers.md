## 6.5 Followers

A **follower** is a **supporting character** that travels with you and contributes on a regular basis to your success.

There are two types of followers: **sidekicks** and **retainers**.

**Followers** need not be people, or even sentient beings: you can write up a spirit guardian, trusty robot, or companion animal as a **follower**.

### 6.5.1 Sidekick

A **sidekick** is a **supporting character** under your control. Most of the time they stay at your side to render assistance, but they can also go off and perform errands or missions on their own.

You should give your **sidekick** a name. You should, when asked, explain how the **sidekick** came to be your **follower**, and why they continue in that role.

**Sidekicks** start with three **abilities**, one rated at 15 and the others at 10. Any of these **abilities** may be a **keyword**. At least one of them should indicate a **distinguishing characteristic**.

If the sidekick is nonhuman or a member of an unusual culture, one of its three starting **abilities** must be its species or culture **keyword**.

Once you have determined the **sidekick’s** base **abilities**, you can allocate 10 **improvement points** amongst them, as described in Assigning Ability Ratings (see $3.4).

You can improve these **abilities** through the expenditure of **experience points**.

You may use any of your **sidekick’s abilities** as your own. The **sidekick** can go off and do things without you.

### 6.5.2 Retainers

A **retainer** is a more or less anonymous servant or helper. You may specify a single **retainer**, or, where appropriate to your character concept, an entire staff of them.

Like any other **ability**, a **retainer** **ability** allows you to overcome relevant **story obstacles** by engaging in a **contest**. To model the contribution of **retainers**, when you are acting, you can use them to **augment** your **ability**. Your GM can rule that **consequences** apply to **retainers**.

**Retainers** generally regard you with all the affection and loyalty due to an employer or master. If you treat them more poorly than is expected for their culture, your GM should increase the **resistance** of attempts to make use of their talents.
