## 9.2 Drawing on Resources

You can use community **resources** as a **bonus** to your **abilities** after convincing the community to let you expend precious assets. This requires a preliminary **contest** using a social **ability**, most likely your community **keyword**. Your GM will use a **moderate resistance** as the baseline, with higher **resistance**s when your proposals seem selfish or likely to fail, and lower ones when everyone but the dullest dolt would readily see their collective benefits. Your GM may increase **resistance**s if your group draws constantly on community **resources** without replenishing them.

The lobbying effort and the actual resource use require framing, a clear description of what you are doing, and other details to bring them to fictional life. You cannot use **resource abilities** directly, but as an **bonus** to your own **abilities**.

Use of community **resources** should pass the threshold for being *memorable* and *entertaining*. Normally there should be a clear benefit to the community, or risk to the community. The PC's actions should be in support of the community, not themselves. Community involvement becomes part of the story. A certain amount of routine support for your character is assumed; a **bonus** implies that the community is expending abnormal effort on your behalf, that will cost the community itself.

### 9.2.1 Resource Depletion

Unlike character abilities, each use of community **resources** temporarily **depletes** it. Regardless of **outcome** a **resource** takes a **penalty** of -5 when used. Effectively, this reduces the **bonus** by 5.

Your GM decides when a **resource** is restored to its original value. Your GM should decide what the credible interval is for the community to recover from the expenditure of effort. At that point, your GM restores the **bonus** for the **resource**.

You might chose to use a **resource** when it is already depleted, in which case you use it at its reduced value. Your GM may use this to represent attrition to your community from a continued struggle. A **resource** that is depleted enough to fall below *zero*  becomes a **penalty**.

Threats to community **resources** act as a spur to PC action. Your GM may rule that the  **outcome** from a **contest** where you did not use the **resource** may still deplete a community **resource**.

### 9.2.2 Required Resource Use

As part of your GM's setting design, they may specify that certain actions in a setting always require the use of a community **resource**. Because the **resource** use is obligatory, it need not meet the usual criteria for entertainment value.

### 9.2.4 Resource as a Penalty

A **resource's** **bonus** may fall below 0. If you require use of a community's **resources** (see §9.2.2) your actions will be subject to a **penalty**.

### 9.2.4 Bolstering Resources

Your GM may offer you the opportunity to **bolster** a community **resources** ahead of need by seeking out and overcoming relevant **story obstacles**. If you succeed, the community resource improves by +5. Your GM will set the **resistance** for the **bolster**. The community's higher ranked resources should have higher **resistances** to **bolstering**. As a default, use the current **bonus** as the **modifier** to **base resistance** as the **TN** for the **bolstering**.

For clarity, a **resource** rated at +M can be bolstered to +M2.

**Bolstering** lasts until the **resource** is used. When your GM depletes a **bolstered resource** following usage, they remove only the additional +5 from **bolstering**.

If a **resource** is already suffering from a **penalty**, bolstering removes that **penalty** instead of improving it by +5.

### 9.2.5 Background Events

In the background all sorts of other events periodically alter the community’s prosperity. These include the actions of other community members, who are **depleting and bolstering resources** all the time, as well as the unexpected intrusion of outside forces.

Your GM may decide that the community's **bonus** in a **resource** is temporarily at a higher or lower due to these outside events. Your GM decides when the **resource** returns to normal. This may require you to overcome a **story obstacle**.
