## 8.1 Earning Experience Points

You gain one **experience points** for any of the following:

* When your **outcome** for a **contest** is a **defeat**.
* Your GM uses a **flaw** or other **ability** against you in a contest with you (see ยง2.6). This happens either when the story forced you to confront a **flaw**, or the GM gave you a **hindrance** (see ยง3.4), if the **hindrance** results in a **penalty**.

Note the following restrictions:

* You only gain an **experience point** for each of your **abilities** or **flaws** once in a session of game play.
* You do not get **experience points** for an **augment**, **AP gifting** or **assist**.
* You do not gain an **experience point** from an **assured contest**, even if you roll to determine **benefits** or **consequences**.

You can gain a maximum of five **experience points** in any one session. Once you have earned five **experience points**, you cannot gain further **experience points** in that session. 

### 8.1.1 Experience on Defeat

Awarding **experience points** on **defeat** is a self-correction mechanism.

* It slows your advance if your PC regularly outclass the **resistance**. This pushes your GM to introduce threats that **credibly** present a greater threat to your PC.
* If you regularly buy off **defeat** with **story points** you will find it harder to advance. In *QuestWorlds* your GM should provide an entertaining story branch on defeat;  you should not need to buy **defeat** off, unless it damages your character conception or is the climax.

If the GM finds that the PCs are no longer regularly earning **experience points** they can consider using **resistance progression** (see ยง2.8) to increase the **base resistance** so that more **contests** will feature a high enough resistance to earn **experience points**.
