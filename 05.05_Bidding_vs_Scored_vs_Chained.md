## 5.5 Wagered Sequences vs Scored Sequences vs Chained Sequences

We recommend that your GM chooses ONE form of **sequence** only, and stick to it, within a given campaign of *QuestWorlds*. If in doubt, use a **scored sequence** by default. The **sequence** rules presentation here is modular: your GMs should choose the one that matches their genre.

**Scored sequences** have the advantage of speed and simplicity. **Wagered sequences** have the drama of wagering APs for your action. **Chained sequences** offer the benefit of grittier exchanges where the **outcomes** of each **round** have impact.

You can think of this as a continuum. At one end are gritty genres where you want to use a **chained sequence** to reflect how punishing conflict is. At the other end are gonzo, larger-than-life genres where you want to use a **wagered sequence** to encourage crazy stunts and outrageous action. In the middle is the **scored sequence** which lets you focus in on tasks to add suspense and drama, without being too grim or too over-the-top.
