## 8.2 Improving Your Character

When you accumulate 10 **experience points**, you can buy an **advance**. An **advance** allows you to select two of the following. You cannot choose an element more than once.

- 10 **improvement points** across a standalone **abilities** or breakout **abilities**; or 5  **improvement points** across  **keywords**.
- 10 **improvement points** across a standalone **abilities** or breakout **abilities**; or 5  **improvement points** across  **keywords**.
- a new breakout **ability** at + 5.
- a new standalone **ability** at 10.
- Turn a stand-alone **ability** into a **keyword** by adding a new +5 breakout **ability** to it.
- Drop a **flaw**, or turn it into an **ability** if story appropriate and agreed with the GM.
- Replace a **supporting character** who has been lost (see ยง6.1).

In addition, if you have less than three **flaws**, you may add another, provided it fits the story, when you take an **advance**.

You may spend **improvement points** immediately, or in play, even after a roll.

In some genres you may wish to maintain a tally of the total **experience points** earned as a measure of your reputation.

### 8.2.2 Rate of Advancement

We assume an average earning rate of two **experience points** per session. This would lead to you gaining an advance every five sessions. If your rate is lower than one **experience point** a session, your GM should choose one of these options:

- Provide more credible threats
- Use **resistance progression**
- Reduce the cost of an **advance** to five **experience points**.

### 8.2.2 Directed Improvements

On occasion your GM may increase one of your **abilities**, by +5, +10 or +15, or give you a new **ability**, usually rated at 10. These are called **directed improvements**.

**Directed improvements** are usually rewards for overcoming particularly important or dramatic **story obstacles** or answering a dramatically important **story question**.

Your GM will tend to use them to raise **abilities** that would otherwise fall behind, but should increase due to story logic, or introduce new **abilities** for the same reason.

Your GM might give you a new **flaw** to represent a story outcome from a contest, that leads you with a hindrance to future action. If you have three or more **flaws** you can ask your GM to drop one in favor of the new **flaw**, if you it seems story appropriate.

### 8.2.3 Timing of Improvements

Your improvements happen immediately, when you cross the threshold to buy an **advance**, or a GM awards you a **directed improvement**.
