# 0.1 Legal Information

The *QuestWorlds* System Reference Document 0.97 (“QWSRD0.97”) describes the rules of *QuestWorlds*. You may incorporate the rules as they appear in QWSRD0.97, wholly or in part, into a derivative work, through the use of the ORC License. You should read and understand the terms of that License before creating a derivative work from QWSRD0.97.


### 0.1.1 Using This License

You should note that this is version of 0.97 of the *QuestWorlds* System Reference Document. We expect to release revised versions of this SRD, especially after development of Chaosium’s upcoming *QuestWorlds Core Book*. When we release the *QuestWorlds Core Book* we will update the version designation to 1.0, indicating that the SRD reflects the text published in that book. If you are developing materials for *QuestWorlds* projects you may want to bear this in mind. We will track any changes to the SRD at *https://github.com/ChaosiumInc/QuestWorlds*.

Once we release SRD version 1.0 we expect that to be stable for some time.

If you have questions about this license, please reach out to Moon Design at licensing@chaosium.com.
