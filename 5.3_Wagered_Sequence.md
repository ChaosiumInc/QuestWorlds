## 5.3 Wagered sequence

A **wagered sequence** consists of one or more **rounds**. In a **round** *both* you and your opponent take actions in turn; a pair of **exchanges**. Each **exchange** is a **contest**.

In a **wagered sequence**, we *tally* the position of the contestants in **advantage points (AP)**. Once a contestant reach *zero* or fewer **APs** they lose that a **wagered sequence**.

Your GM should determine who has the initiative to describe what they are doing for any **exchange**. They describe the **tactic** for their **exchange**, and wagers a matching number of **APs**. Their opponent then describes their reaction to that **tactic** to determine the ability used in the contest. Next, their opponent then describes their **tactic** and wagers a matching number of **APs**. The initiative holder then describes their **tactic** in response.

These **exchanges** are then conducted in order of the highest **AP** **wager** first.

If a contestant falls below *zero* **APs** as a result of their opponent's **exchange**, they immediately lose, and do not get to conduct their own **exchange**.

If on the second **exchange** of the **round**, a contestant no longer has the **AP** that they **bid** remaining, they should change their action to reflect a lower **bid**.

If, on the second **exchange** the contestant's original intent no longer makes sense in the unfolding narrative, they can change their **tactic** but they do not change their **wager**.

### 5.3.1 Advantage Points

#### 5.3.1.1 Starting AP Totals

You describe your action towards the desired **prize** and what **ability** you use. The **ability** used in the contest can be varied, but **APs** are always calculated on the first **ability** that you use in a contest. That **ability** must be used in the first **round**.

Figure your starting **advantage point (AP)** total using the **TN**. So a **TN** of 15 is 15**APs**. The **AP** include +20 for each level of **mastery**, so a **TN** of 5M is 25**APs**. Your starting **APs** and can also be increased by **followers** (see below).

The GM figures starting **APs** for the **resistance** from the **resistance** **TN**.

#### 5.3.1.2  Wagering Advantage Points

You gamble a number of your **APs** in an attempt to reduce your opponent’s **AP**, but if you fail the attempt you lose the **AP** or may even transfer them.

You describe your action towards the desired **prize**, what **ability** you use, and how much risk you take. “I want to climb straight up to that outcrop, taking chances if needed.” You should specify your **wager**; if you do not, your GM determines this based on the amount of risk you are taking.

The size of the **wager** mirrors how bold and risky your character’s action is. Extreme or aggressive actions mean a high **wager**, and cautious actions require less. 

If you describe an all-out offensive with your sword cutting vicious arcs, you need to wager a lot of **APs**; if you say that you are circling your foe cautiously, a low **wager** is in order.

Your GM  will look at the level of risk you are taking, and may suggest that you change your **wager** to better match your actions.

If you do not declare a **wager** before rolling the die, your GM will decide how many points are **wager** (using 3 as a default), with riskier actions calling for higher **wagers**.

#### 5.3.1.3 Losing Advantage Points

The number of advantage points lost by a contestant is a multiplier of their **wager** depending on the **degree** of the **victory**. Determine the multiplier used as follows:

#### 5.3.1.4 WAGERED SEQUENCE EXCHANGE TABLE

|Degree    |AP loss by loser|
|:------:|:------------:|
|Tie|Both lose 1/2 wager, round up|
|0|½ x wager, round up|
|1|1 x wager|
|2|2 x wager|
|3|3 x wager|
|4|4 x wager|
|*n*|*n* x wager|

If the victor rolled a **big success**, the **APs** lost by the loser are gained by the winner - a **transfer**.

#### 5.3.1.5  Followers and Advantage Points

**Followers** can act in *one* of the following ways during a **contest**:

* A follower can **augment** you with their **abilities**.
* You can use one of their **abilities** as if it were your own.
* For a **follower** with a relevant **ability** or **keyword**, you can simply add their **APs** to yours at the beginning of the **contest**.

Neither you nor the GM makes rolls for **followers**. Instead, their actions are subsumed into yours.

You can assign your **followers** to someone else, although you may have to succeed at a contest to persuade a reluctant follower to go along.

#### 5.3.1.6 Advantage Point Knowledge

Once your opponent has won or lost **APs** during the current contest, you can ask the GM what the opposition's **AP** total is. This is where the element of skill comes in. When choosing how many **APs** to stake, you must weigh the effect they want to gain if you succeed versus the risk you face if the action fails.

#### 5.3.1.7 Advantage Point Recalculation

**Advantage points** are only relevant for the length of a particular **wagered sequence**. Your PC does not have any until the next **wagered sequence** begins, when you calculate them all over again.

#### 5.3.1.8 What the AP Total Means

**Advantage points** represent who has the advantage in a **sequence**. They represent who is enters the fray in the best starting position because of skill, support, or conviction.

Losses represent:

* Losing *momentum*.
* Becoming overcome by *fatigue*.
* *Morale* is failing.
* Becoming close to losing *consciousness* from repeated blows.
* Losing the support of the *audience*.

If the opposition represents multiple opponents, then an **AP** loss may represent their ranks thinning.

When your GM narrates **AP** losses they need to be guided by two principals:

1. No effect is certain until the entire **wagered sequence** is over.
2. When a character loses points, it can reflect any negative change in fortunes, not just the most obvious one.

### 5.3.2 Wagered Sequence Outcomes

Your GM uses the final **AP** total of the loser to determine the **degree** of the **victory** or **defeat** for the PC.

#### 5.3.2.1 WAGERED SEQUENCE OUTCOME TABLE

|Final AP Total  |Degree|
|:--------------:|:-------------:|
|0 to –10 AP     |0              |
|–11 to –20 AP   |1              |
|–21 to –30 AP   |2              |
|–31 or -40 AP   |3              |
|–41 or fewer AP |4              |

Your GM may apply **consequences** and **benefits**  for your PC as they see fit, based on this outcome. 

### 5.3.3 Parting Shot
A **parting shot** allows another round, in which only contestants with positive **APs** can act. You once again **wager** **APs** and use an appropriate **ability** against your opponent. Your **wager** must reflect what you are doing to drive them to greater defeat.

If you succeed, their **AP** will decrease; their **outcome** may or may not change.

**Parting shots** are risky; if you fail, an **AP** transfer might bring your opponent back into positive **APs** in which case they get an **exchange** in this **round** (and subsequent rounds as normal). Your stumble gave them an opening that they exploited in an effort to snatch **victory** from the jaws of **defeat**.

### 5.3.4 Desperation Stake

You can stake more **advantage points** than you currently have, to a maximum of your starting **AP** total. This allows you to attempt a **desperation stake** even when you are within a single **AP** of **defeat**. Your GM can never stake more **advantage points** than they have.

### 5.3.5 Second Chance

If your PC falls to 0 or fewer **advantage points** in a standard **wagered sequence**, you are **defeated**. In a **group wagered sequence**, however, you can try a **second chance** to stay in the **contest**. A **second chance** represents the knack to come back when your opponent turns away to gloat or deal with the other player characters. A character may only attempt one **second chance** in any **wagered sequence**.

To attempt a **second chance**, you must be free from attention by the opposition. You must spend a **story point**. You can use a relevant **ability** in a **contest** against the number of **APs** your PC is below 0. Even if you succeed, a **consequence** applies: take a –6 to further actions in this contest.

If you win the **contest**, you rejoin the contest with a positive **AP** total. Your new total is a 1/4 of your original **AP** total at the outset of the **contest**, round up.

Your GM should not use a **second chance** for the **resistance**.

Your GM may decide to impost a **consequence** on you, even if you are later victorious in a contest, or your team wins the prize, that represents the adversity you suffered that brought you initially to defeat.

### 5.3.6 Assists

You can transfer some or all of your **advantage points** to another contestant engaged in a **wagered sequence** on your side. With more **advantage points**, they can stay in the **sequence** for longer, or make larger **wagers** without driving themselves to **defeat**.

State the number of **AP** you are trying to transfer. (The GM may suggest a higher or lower **wager** based on the action you describe.) The number of **APs** you are attempting to transfer is the **resistance** you face in a **contest**. You lose the **APs** whether or not you **succeed** in the contest.

You cannot transfer **advantage points** to yourself.

If a **follower’s AP** are already included in your **AP** total, the **follower** cannot transfer them to you.
