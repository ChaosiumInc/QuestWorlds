## 2.12 Mass Effort

Clashes of massive forces resolve like any other **contest** or **sequence**. These include:

* Military engagements
* Corporate struggles for market share
* Building competitions
* Efforts to spread a faith or ideology
* Dance competitions

If you are not participating in the **contest** and have no stake in its **outcome**, then your GM doesn’t bother to run a **contest**. The GM just chooses an **outcome** for dramatic purposes.

Otherwise, your GM will start by determining your degree of influence over the **outcome**. They are either:

* **Directing**: The success of the effort depends mostly on your leadership. For example, you might be a military leader facing a force of roughly equal potency. As all else is equal, the better general will win the day. In this instance, if you are in command, your **tactic** should be a relevant leadership **ability**.
* **Contributors**: The outcome of the battle hangs in the balance and your efforts may tip the balance in favor of your side. You roll against a **resistance** determined by the GM, either in a **contest** (see §4.0) or **sequence** (see §5.0) representing the odds of your shifting the odds in your favor. If a PC leads the effort your GM should award them a **bonus** or **penalty** reflecting the **outcome** of the contest. They should then roll as described in Directing above. If an NPC leads the effort the **outcome** is that of the **contest** or **sequence**, and the PCs effort is assumed to tip the scale either way.
* **Participants**: You have little influence over the **outcome**, but must struggle to prosper within the conflict. The GM predetermines the **outcome** of the overall competition on dramatic grounds. To determine your fate in the battle, you roll against a **resistance** determined by the GM from the overall battle **outcome**, in a **contest** (see §4.0) or **sequence** (see §5.0).
