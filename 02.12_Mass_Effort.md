## 2.12 Mass Effort

Clashes of massive forces resolve like any other **contest**, **simple** or **long**. These include:

* Military engagements
* Corporate struggles for market share
* Building competitions
* Efforts to spread a faith or ideology
* Dance competitions

If you are not participating in the **contest** and have no stake in its **outcome**, then your GM doesnâ€™t bother to run a **contest**. The GM just chooses an **outcome** for dramatic purposes.

Otherwise, your GM will start by determining your degree of influence over the **outcome**. They are either:

* Determining factors: The success of the effort depends mostly on your choices and successes. For example, you might be a military leader facing a force of roughly equal potency. As all else is equal, the better general will win the day. In this instance, your **tactic** should be a relevant leadership **ability**.
* Contributors: One of the forces enjoys a clear advantage over the others, but your efforts may tip the balance in favor of a chosen side. Your GM will give you a **rating** to roll against that represents the strength of your force, but you can **augment** that **rating** with an appropriate leadership **ability**.
* Acted Upon: You have little influence over the **outcome**, but are stuck in the middle of the conflict and must struggle to prosper within it. The GM predetermines the **outcome** of the overall competition on dramatic grounds. To determine your fate in the battle, you **contest** against a **resistance** determined by the GM, derived from the overall battle **outcome**.
