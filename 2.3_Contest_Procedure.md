## 2.3 Contest Procedure

You choose an **ability** relevant to the conflict at hand, describe exactly what you are trying to accomplish, and how. Your GM may modify these suggested actions to better fit the fictional circumstances, and describe the actions of the NPCs or forces on the other side of the conflict.

### 2.3.1 Resolution Methods

The basic resolution methods are as follows:

#### 2.3.1.1 Assured Contest

Some **obstacles** don't require a roll to overcome. You’ll just do it and keep going, much as you get dressed in the morning or drive your car to work. We call these kinds of contests **assured** contests because your **victory** is assured. Your GM may want to describe your **victory** as a sweat inducing challenge for you, even though there is no risk of **defeat**, to highlight the heroic struggle of your PC to beat the obstacle, nonetheless.

As your character advances, the challenges that qualify for assured contests will become more complex. If you face a driving challenge, the bar for assured will be much lower for a champion Formula 1 racer than a typical commuter.

**Assured contests** are the GM’s primary tool to establish your character’s competence. This makes them one of the most powerful and frequently used tools in a GM’s tool chest. Remember, your GM doesn’t have to, and usually shouldn’t advise you you’re involved in an **assured contest**, so it's best to treat all **contests** as if your skin is on the line.

Your GM may also use an **assured contest** when there is no interesting story branch from **defeat**. If failing to open the derelict spaceship's hatch means that the story of your exploration of the ancient space hulk would end abruptly, your GM may choose to make it an **assured contest**. **Assured contests** may be used to find clues when your GM is running a mystery and correct application of one of your **abilities** should reveal the information and allow the story to continue, over becoming mired due to a missed roll and missing clue.

Sometimes your GM will decide potential complications could arise in overcoming an **story obstacle**. Or they may want to give you a **bonus** if you do particularly well. If so, they will call for you to make a die roll even though your **victory** is not in question. Your GM will use your die roll **result** to decide if any unforeseen **consequences** or **benefits** arose from your actions.

If you roll a **failure**, you still beat the obstacle, but you also suffer an adverse **consequence** (see §2.7). The nature of this adversity is up to the GM. It will probably be a **penalty** involving the same tactic you used in this one (because you exhausted yourself, sprained an ankle, embarrassed yourself in front of your peers, etc.) or to the value of one of your relationships.

If you achieve a high **result**, you’ll receive a **benefit** from your effort (see §2.6). Again, this is up to the GM to define. It could be a **bonus** to the **tactic** used in the **contest**, or to of one of your relationships, etc.

An **assured contest** can be summarized as follows:

1. You and your GM agree upon the terms of the **contest**.
2. The GM may decide that you simply gain the **victory** and there are no **consequences** or **benefits** beyond that.
3. If not the GM conducts a contest.
4. You roll a D20 vs your relevant **ability**, while your GM rolls a D20 vs the **resistance**.
5. Your GM assesses any **consequences** or **benefits**.
6. Your GM then narrates how you obtained your **victory** and any **benefits** or **consequences** that arose.

#### 2.3.1.2 Simple Contest

The **simple contest** is *QuestWorlds*' primary resolution mechanic for overcoming **story obstacles**, and is used the most often where the outcome is uncertain. It also provides the foundation for other types of uncertain **contest**, including several **long** ones. As such, it receives both an overview of key concepts here as well as a more detailed treatment in §4.

A **simple contest** can be summarized as follows:

1. You and your GM agree upon the terms of the **contest**.
2. You roll a D20 vs your relevant **ability**, while your GM rolls a D20 vs the **resistance**.
3. Your GM compares the difference **successes** between the two rolls, and assesses **victory** or **defeat**.
4. Your GM then narrates the **outcome** of the conflict as appropriate and asseses any **benefits** or **consequences** that arose (see §2.7).

If you enter into conflict with another player rather than a **story obstacle** presented by your GM, you both roll your relevant abilities for the **contest** instead of against a GM-set **resistance**, and your GM interprets the **results**, as described above.

### 2.3.2 Framing the Contest

#### 2.3.2.1 Contest Framing Overview

When a conflict arises during the game, you and your GM start by clearly agreeing on:

* What goal you are trying to achieve. We call this the **prize**.
* What the **story obstacle** is you are trying to overcome.
* What **tactic** you are using to and overcome it.

This process is called **framing the contest**.

#### 2.3.2.2 Conflict: Goals vs Obstacles

**Contests** in *QuestWorlds* don’t simply tell you how well you performed at a particular task: they tell you whether or not you overcame a **story obstacle**, which moves the story in a new direction. Unlike some other roleplaying games, a **contest** in *QuestWorlds* does not resolve a task, it resolves the whole **story obstacle**.

If you need secret records which are stored in a vault within a government compound, your goal is to get the information - while the fact that it is secured against your access is a **story obstacle** you must overcome to attain that goal. Overcoming that **story obstacle** may involve many possible tasks, evading guards, lock-picking, forging credentials, etc. - but the **contest** doesn't address those individually. The **contest** is framed around the entire conflict against the **story obstacle** as a whole.

In a fight, your **story obstacle** may be the opponents themselves, who you are fighting to capture or kill. Just as often you are seeking another goal and you might just as easily attain it by incapacitating or evading your foes. In this case, beating the enemy is a task, not the **story obstacle**. For example, if an **ally** has been accused of treason by the King, your goal could be to prove the **ally's** innocence. The power of the King threatening your **ally** is a **story obstacle** to be overcome, and a trial by combat could be a **contest** to resolve the conflict with an **ability** like "Knight Errant."

In a court trial, your goal is likely a particular verdict, while the **story obstacle** might be the opposing lawyer, an unjust law, or even the justice system itself.  In this case, jury selection, a closing argument, revelatory evidence, or legal procedural challenges are tasks, not the entire **story obstacle**. The overall conflict encompasses all those things.

A conflict to overcome a **story obstacle** moves the story forward when it is resolved. If it is merely a step toward resolving a **story obstacle** it is a task and not a conflict. While those component tasks may be interesting parts of narrating **tactics** and **results**, your GM should be sure to look for the **story obstacle** in conflict when framing a **contest**.

If there is no **story obstacle** to your actions, your GM should not call for a **contest** but simply let you narrate what you do, provided that seems credible.

For example, you are traveling from one star system to another. In the next star system you hope to confront the aged rebel who holds long-forgotten secrets that could bring freedom to the galaxy. Your GM feels there is no useful **story obstacle** for you to **contest** against, and so lets you describe heading down to the spaceport to secure a ship, meeting the captain and crew of your vessel, and traveling to the next world. Your GM encourages you to summarize what happens quickly so you can get to the meeting with the old rebel. Your GM knows that will be the real **story obstacle**, convincing the old rebel to part with their secrets.

#### 2.3.2.3 Tactics

You either choose an **ability** that represents any 'key moment' in overcoming that **story obstacle**, or a broad **ability** that lets you overcome the whole **story obstacle**. We call this choosing a **tactic**.

The **rating** from your **ability score**, after adding any **augment** (see §2.5) or **modifiers** (see §2.4), relevant **consequences** or **benefits** (see §2.6) is your **target number**.

Your **tactic** might describe your using an **ability** that helps you overcome a task within the **story obstacle**:  sneaking past the guards, picking the locks, choosing the right jury or skewering your opponent with your foil. Or, your **tactics** might describe using a broad ability like "Ninja", "Lawyer", or "Fencer" to overcome all those challenges that might form part of the **story obstacle**. Either way, if you succeed at that roll, you overcome the whole **story obstacle**. Or by failing at that roll, you fail to overcome the **story obstacle**, not just fail at one task.

When deciding on your **tactic**, focus on how your unique abilities would help you overcome the **story obstacle**. This as the "key moment" where we focus on your PC. Use this moment to reveal your PC's strengths to the group.

Your GM will determine if your **tactic** passes a **credibility test**. If you try to jump a 100 meters gap or run faster than a speeding car, your action is not credible and your GM will ask you to choose a different **tactic**.

Credibility depends on the genre, as what is not credible in a gritty police procedural might be in pulp where you might be able to leap from a bridge onto a speeding train. If in dispute, your GM should discuss with the group whether they consider your **tactic** credible for the genre.

**Extraordinary abilities** in some genres give you the capability to do the incredible. For example in a superhero genre you might fly or be invulnerable to bullets, in a fantasy genre hurl magical lightning bolts. A genre pack for the game should help define what incredible **tactics** are allowed for that game as part of an *Extraordinary Powers Framework*.

The GM can narrate the remaining tasks that make sense of the story depending on your **success** with that roll, or have them occur 'off-stage' for speed. Think of the way TV or Cinema often cuts to the key moment of drama in a break-in, over showing us the whole heist from beginning to end.

#### 2.3.2.4 No Repeat Attempts

A **contest** represents all of your attempts to overcome a **story obstacle**. If you lose it means that no matter how many times you tried to solve the problem, you finally had to give up. You can try again only if you use a new **tactic** to overcome the **story obstacle**.

### 2.3.3 Rank

Your GM uses a scale known as a **rank** when choosing to adjust a **target number**. For a PC, that adjustment may come from an **augment** (see §2.5), **modifier** (see §2.4), **benefits** or **consequences** (see §2.7). Your GM also uses the same **rank** as a modifier to a **base resistance** when determining the **resistance's** **TN**.

Bonuses to the dice roll use the scale of values: +3, +6. +9, +M, +M2
Penalties to the dice roll use the scale of values: -3, -6, -9, -M, -M2

You should be able to memorize these values in play, and just go up or down the scale, instead of translating a **rank** to a value.  For convenience the following table shows the scale of **ranks**.

By default, the **base resistance** starts at 14.

### 2.3.4 Resistance

Your GM chooses a **resistance** to represent the difficulty of the **story obstacle**.

When setting **resistance**s it is important to understand that whilst traditional roleplaying games simulate an imaginary reality, *QuestWorlds* emulates the techniques of fictional storytelling.

Understanding this distinction will help you to play the game in a natural, seamless manner.

For example, let’s say that your GM is playing a game inspired by fast-paced, non-fantastic, martial arts movies in a contemporary setting. You are running along a bridge, pacing a hovercraft, piloted by the main bad guy. You want your character, Joey Chun, to jump onto the hovercraft and punch the villain’s lights out.

In a traditional, simulative game, your GM would determine how hard this is based on the physical constraints you’ve already described. In doing so, they would come up with imaginary numbers and measurements. Your GM would have to work out the distance between bridge and hovercraft. Depending on the rules set, they might take into account your relative speed to the vehicle. Then they would use whatever resolution mechanic the rules provide them with to see if Joey succeeds or fails. If you blow it, your GM will probably consult the falling rules to see how badly you injure yourself (if you land poorly), or the drowning rules, if you end up in the river.

In *QuestWorlds*, your GM starts not with the physical details, but with the proposed action’s position in the storyline. They consider a range of narrative factors, from how entertaining it would be for you to **succeed**, how much **failure** would slow the pacing of the current sequence, and how long it has been since you last scored a thrilling **victory**. If, after this, they need further reference points, your GM can draw inspiration more from martial arts movies than the physics of real-life jumps from bridges onto moving hovercraft. Having decided how difficult the task ought to be dramatically,your GM will then supply the physical details as color, to justify their choice and create suspension of disbelief, the illusion of authenticity that makes us accept fictional incidents as credible on their own terms. If they want Joey to have a high chance of **success**, your GM describes the distance between bridge and vehicle as impressive (so it feels exciting if you make it) but not insurmountable (so it seems believable if you make it).

In other words, in *QuestWorlds* your GM will pick a **resistance** based on dramatic needs and then justify it by adding details into the story.

Your GM determines the **resistance** from a **base resistance** modified by a **rank** depending on their view of how difficult the obstacle is for you. Increasing **ranks** make it harder to succeed, and decreasing **ranks** easier.
  
The **rank** never reduces the **resistance** value below 0. If the GM assesses a **rank** for the resistance that would take the **target number** below 0, it becomes an **assured contest**.

All **contests** use the **base resistance** + **rank**, except for **contests** to determine **augments**. **Augmenting** always faces the **base resistance**.

### 2.3.5 Die Rolls

To determine how well you use an **ability**, roll a 20-sided die (D20). At the same time, your GM rolls for the **resistance**.

Compare your rolled number with your **Target Number** to determine the **result**.

* **Critical**: If the die roll is equal to the **TN**, you succeed brilliantly, and gain *one* **success** and a **bump**. This is the best **result** possible.
* **Success**: If the die roll is less than the **TN**, you succeed, but there is nothing remarkable about the success. You have *one* **success**.
* **Failure**: If the die roll is greater than the **TN**, you fail. Things do not happen as hoped. You gain *zero* **successes**

### 2.3.6 Bumps

A **bump** gives you an additional **success**. A **bump** comes from one of **three sources**.

* A **critical** die roll gives you a **bump**.
* A **mastery** gives you a **bump**.
* You can spend a **story point** (see §7.0) to receive a **bump**.

Because of this rule, a **critical** gives you *two* **successes**, and a PC with a **mastery** will always gain one **success**.

### 2.3.7 Outcome

Your **successes** and the **resistance's** successes are compared to determine your overall **outcome** which will be either **victory** or **defeat** for the **contest** as a whole.

If you have a *more* **successes** than the GM, then you have a **victory** and you gain the **prize** set out when the **contest** was framed.

If you have a *fewer* **successes** than the GM, then you are **defeated** and do not gain the **prize**.

If you both have the *same* **successes**, including if neither of you has any **successes**, the higher roll wins. If your rolls tie, then it is a standoff.

#### 2.3.7.1 Narrating Outcomes

Your GM narrates the contest **outcome**. Their narration should take into account the **prize** and the **tactics** used by each side. Your GM may invite you to contribute more detail on your actions as part of that narration, if they wish. But the GM is the final arbiter of how the story progresses as a result of the rolls - provided they respect the **outcome** in which you win or lose the **prize**.

 Your GM should bear in mind your **result** when describing the outcome. We refer to the *difference* between the number of **successes** earned by the victor and the number earned by the loser as the **authority** of the victory. The **authority** is a guide for the GM when narrating the outcome as to how convincing a victory was. If you have an **authority** of *zero*, the GM should describe your actions as successful, but the **resistance** as competent. If you have an **authority** of *two*, your GM should describe a convincing **victory** in which your adversary is clearly outclassed.

The GM is narrating a car chase through the busy streets of New Los Angeles. The PCs are trying to catch the demon-worshipper Ath'Zul who has stolen The Eye of Lorus from a museum. Some examples of how the GM might interpret **outcomes** as follows:
 
* PC One **Success** vs. Ath'Zul One **Success**, the PC has the higher roll, and an **authority** of *zero*: Ath'Zul tries to shake the PCs, his hover bike, weaving in and out of traffic, but the PCs are always on his tail, and catch him at the lights on Bradbury Junction.
* PC One **Success** vs. Ath'Zul No **Successes**, the PC has an **authority** of *one*: Ath'Zul tries to shake the PCs, his hover bike, weaving in and out of traffic, but the PCs force him off the road, where his bike loses repulsor lift and halts.
* PC Two **Successes** vs. Ath'Zul No **Successes**, the PC has an **authority** of *two*: Ath'Zul tries to shake the PCs, his hover bike, weaving in and out of traffic, but he crashes into a parked car, spilling Ath'Zul and the stolen artefact over the road.

Your GM should avoid robbing your PC of competence by describing your **defeat** as due to your incompetence when you may have rolled a **critical** or a **success**.

#### 2.3.7.2 Confusing Ties

Your GM will describe most tied **outcomes** as inconclusive standoffs, in which neither of you gets what you wanted.

In some situations, ties become difficult to visualize. Chief among these are **contest**s with binary **outcomes**, where only two possible results are conceivable.

Your GM can either change the situation on such a tie, introducing a new element that likely renders the original **prize** irrelevant to both participants, or they can resolve the ties in your favor as a **victory**.
