## 9.1 Community Design

### 9.1.1 Defining Resources

Communities have **resources** that your GM defines. Your PC can try to draw on their community's **resources** to use them as **bonus**. If your community is in difficulty, a strained **resource** might act as a **penalty**. Your GM should focus on no more than five or so broadly-labeled **resource** types, so that the PCs can care about (and have a chance of successfully managing) all of them.

Most communities have variants of the following **resources**, perhaps with more colorful names:

* Wealth — the capacity of the community to provide financial help, whether counted primarily in dollars, credits, or cattle
* Diplomacy — the relationships with other groups through which a community can obtain favors, while minimizing the cost of its reciprocal obligations
* Morale — the community’s resolve to achieve its goals, and willingness to follow the directives of its leaders

The following abilities might appear, depending on setting:

* Military — its capacity to defend itself from outside threats, and to aggressively achieve its own aims through force of arms (for settings where communities of the size you’re tracking field their own armed units)
* Magic — the capability of a community to perform supernatural acts (for fantasy worlds)
* Technology — its access to specialized, rare or secret devices or scientific knowledge not shared by its rivals (for post- apocalyptic or SF worlds)

Similar communities in the genre, should have the same set of **resources**.

### 9.1.2 Rating Resources

Your GM distributes each of the **degrees** 0-3 between the four of the five **resources**. The last resource has no **bonus** So each  of the **degrees**: 3 (+M), 2(+15), 1(+10) 0(+5) and 0 should apply to one resource. Note that the size of the group doesn’t affect the **degrees**.

### 9.1.3 Community Questionnaires

Your GM may create a questionnaire that asks the players to make choices about the priorities of their community. The responses to each question should be multiple-choice. Each choice you make adds points to a score for each **resource** type. Points are awarded according to what the answer reveals about the community's relative priorities. An answer may give points to more than one **resource**.

You can choose your answers by consensus, majority vote, or take turns.

When you’re done, rank the **resources** in the order of the scores. Assign the high **degrees** to the highest scores and the lowest to the low.

A questionnaire also introduces your setting in a punchy, interactive format, and tailors the community to the players’ desires, increasing their investment in it.
